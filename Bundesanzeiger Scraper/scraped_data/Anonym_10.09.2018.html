<p>Our results reflect a high level of activity in the Group's various
                              business lines - asset gathering, retail banking, specialised financial
                              services and large customers. These are even the best results for
                              the last ten years for both Crédit Agricole S.A. and the Group perimeter
                              which includes the Regional Banks. They were achieved in spite of
                              exceptional items, taxes in particular, such as the surtax imposed
                              by the government at the end of the year. These results confirm and
                              validate the relevance of our strategy.
                              </p>
<p>We continue to refocus on our core activities with for instance
                              the sale of part of our stake in Bank Saudi Fransi. Our diversified
                              and profitable business model encourages solid organic growth in all
                              our business lines and allows us to maintain a high level of operational
                              efficiency while creating flexibility for growth investments.
                              </p>
<p>In addition to the business lines commercial and financial performance
                              as well as our profitability, I would like to emphasize the Group's
                              overall ability to adapt and innovate within an environment whose
                              regulations and practices are constantly changing, and which is welcoming
                              new players, something I view as a positive development. Indeed, these
                              newcomers stimulate our own capacity to innovate and to stand out
                              from the competition. By highlighting our ability to partner with
                              clients and offer a global variety of services from which to choose,
                              we distinguish ourselves from these new players whose offering is
                              restricted to a single channel. This is a central aspect of our Client
                              Project.
                              </p>
<p>Our cooperative model allows us both to innovate and to capitalise
                              on our values of solidarity, loyalty, responsibility and collective
                              interest. Our ideas about transforming the Group are guided by the
                              search for efficiency in serving our stakeholders: shareholders, institutional
                              and private investors, clients, employees.

<p>"A wide collaborative approach to innovation was launched to encourage
                              the new ideas that will lead to the bank of the future."
                              </p>
<p>Our results for 2017 are in line with the road map of Strategic
                              Ambition 2020, Crédit Agricole Group's strategic plan. Revenues are
                              higher thanks to the good performance of all business lines. With
                              costs under control, a lower cost of risk and a prudent management
                              of our risk weighted assets, our net result for the year is on the
                              rise.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017 the Bank took steps to meet regulatory challenges and to
                              deal with changes in the banking environment. Our teams are mobilised
                              to comply with the MiFID II Directive aimed at strengthening investor
                              protection and increasing transparency in the financial markets. A
                              wide-ranging collaborative approach to innovation was also launched
                              by the Group with the support of our top management to encourage the
                              new ideas that will lead to the bank of the future.
                              </p>
<p>In the coming years we must gradually adapt our model to the requirements
                              of Basel IV which will apply fully in 2027. Our goal is to continue
                              to originate many loans but to distribute them even more, while defining
                              the business lines' trajectory which must acquire a new dimension.
                              </p>
<p>In the area of climate finance, we have made new commitments that
                              are in line with what we have undertaken during the last few years.
                              We are committed to increase the green investments we arrange to 100
                              billion euros globally by 2020. Our priority remains to provide innovative
                              and useful solutions to support the energy transition. We will achieve
                              this thanks to our conviction, determination and expertise.

                              2017
                              </h4>
<p>The year began in a climate of political turbulence. In fact, the
                              events of 2016, i.e. Brexit and the US elections, continued to rock
                              the political and financial scene throughout the first half of the
                              year. Post-election results dissipated the political risks. 2017 was
                              also marked by low volatility in an environment of low rates. The
                              average Brent crude oil price rose by 25% compared to 2016.
                              </p>
<p>In this context, the Bank's revenues increased by 4% year-on-year,
                              driven in part by the positive effects on the xVA valuation components
                              and in part by the good performance of the financing activities, despite
                              origination constraints during the year in the energy and shipping
                              sectors.
                              </p>
<p>Regarding the financing activities, Crédit Agricole CIB confirmed
                              its position as a leader in aircraft financing<sup>(1)</sup> and moved
                              from 4<sup>th</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup> place in EMEA project financing<sup>(2)</sup>
                              .
                              </p>
<p>In terms of capital market activities, the Bank climbed from 4<sup>th</sup> to
                              2<sup>nd</sup> position on bond issues by public agencies
                              in euros worldwide<sup>(3)</sup> . The Bank also made some significant
                              deals for players such as Softbank and SFR.
                              </p>
<p>Regarding investment banking, Crédit Agricole CIB is ranked 5th
                              in mergers and acquisitions in France<sup>(4)</sup> reflecting sustained
                              activity throughout the year for M&amp;A.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, Crédit Agricole CIB confirmed its position in green
                              financing and rose to the number 1 position worldwide as book-runner
                              on Green Bonds with 59 green transactions carried out in 2017<sup>(5)</sup> . The
                              Bank also distinguished itself this year through significant
                              deals for market players such as China Development Bank and Africa
                              Development Bank.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with Credit Agricole's Medium-Term Plan, "Strategic
                              Ambition 2020", the Bank reaffirms its ambitions internationally.
                              Crédit Agricole CIB boosted its presence in wealth management activities
                              in Asia. In December 2017, Indosuez Wealth Management finalised the
                              acquisition of the private banking activities of Crédit Industriel
                              et Commercial (CIC) in Singapore and all of the share capital of CIC
                              Investors Services in Hong Kong.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, one of the initiatives of the Large Customers division
                              relating to the development of Bridge Financing (synergies between
                              CACIB, CACEIS and Indosuez Wealth Management), initiated in 2016,
                              became fully successful in 2017 and benefits CACIB in International
                              Trade and Transaction Banking (ITB) as part of the financing activities.
                              </p>
<p>On 11 September 2017, Crédit Agricole CIB signed a disposal agreement
                              for 16.2% of Banque Saudi Fransi, out of the 31.1% held, in favour
                              of Kingdom Holding Company (KHC). The transaction was completed on
                              20 September 2017. The net income from this disposal was €102 million,
                              recognised in the Bank's 2017 accounts.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB always strives to best meet the expectations
                              of its customers. In 2017, the Bank enhanced its financing of working
                              capital requirements with an innovative fully automated and integrated
                              Supply Chain Financing solution. This solution is intended for the
                              Bank's large corporate customers and their small, medium and intermediate-sized
                              suppliers.
                              </p>
<p>This offer enables Crédit Agricole CIB customers to offer their
                              suppliers prepayment of their invoices via a web platform, optimising
                              their cash flow and improving their debt-to-equity ratios. Thus, they
                              can build a seamless, long-term relationship with their suppliers
                              while providing efficiency and visibility across their entire supply
                              chain.

<p>Following on from the materiality analysis conducted in 2016, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB developed and launched a FReD plan in 2017 intended to
                              boost the internal endorsement of Corporate Social Responsibility.
                              </p>
<p>The plan incorporates three themes: working to achieve a better
                              understanding of CSR issues, working on new day-today tools and seeking
                              to highlight both internal and external actions. Various initiatives
                              have been implemented with a view to embedding this "CSR culture"
                              in the same way as risk, compliance or legal culture.
                              </p>
<p>Events were held at the amphitheatre (on topics such as biodiversity
                              and responsible purchasing in 2017) as well as less formal meetings
                              between the Sustainable Development team and employees in the form

<p>Summary presentations of sector-wide CSR policies have been drawn
                              up and posted on the Crédit Agricole CIB intranet and website. The
                              Crédit Agricole CIB CSR policy was also published on its website after

<p>CFM-Indosuez launched a FReD initiative in 2017 with a view to
                              better understanding the basic principles of CSR, FReD initiatives
                              at CFM Indosuez Wealth Management and increasing employee involvement
                              on a daily basis. A "best practices" email is sent to all new employees
                              when they start work. An e-learning tool has been created to complement
                              this CSR information and awareness-raising drive. This tool is available
                              to all employees and is automatically offered to all new staff. Indosuez
                              (Europe) has also been working throughout the year to improve its
                              communications regarding CSR and FReD. It has introduced a digital

                              More specifically, this committee issues recommendations prior to

                              Principles, issues opinions and recommendations on transactions classified
                              as sensitive in respect of environmental and social aspects, and approves

<p>The CERES Committee met four times in 2017 to discuss issues such

<p>In 2017, the CERES Committee specifically reviewed 28 transactions

<p>Several meetings were held with non-governmental organisations
                              in 2017 regarding the controversial planned oil pipeline. One of the
                              points in dispute referred to the conditions for applying the Equator
                              Principles in high-income OECD countries, particularly the question
                              of gathering the free, advance and informed of the indigenous people
                              on whom a project has impacts.

<p>The dialogue with civil society and representatives of indigenous
                              peoples have led Crédit Agricole CIB to send a letter to the Equator
                              Principles Association calling for certain improvements to be made
                              to the Equator Principles.

                              the Equator Principles Association to announce at the end of 2017
                              at its General Meeting the beginning of a process to review the Equator

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Satisfaction</h4>
<p>The Bank has a secure process of entering into a relationship with
                              the client and of overseeing the selling of market products. Customer
                              protection involves a comprehensive customer classification system,
                              which not only applies the MIF rules applicable in the European Economic
                              Area (increased protection of nonbusiness customers who receive an
                              investment service), but also more generally and worldwide through
                              an "Internal suitability rating". This system forms part of the sales
                              process, in particular so that the financial instruments offered to
                              customers are in line with their risk awareness.
                              </p>
<p>As part of this process, Compliance issues advance opinions on
                              the transactions considered as sensitive, and will subsequently check
                              that these opinions have been observed.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Compliance pays particular attention to the commercial
                              margins on market products and to the documentation intended for client
                              information, while continuing to file and retain the underlying data
                              appropriately.
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, to support its customers in their growth, the Bank has
                              set up a "New Activities / New Products" (NAP) system, one of the
                              key objectives of which is to ensure that our products and business
                              activities are a good fit for our customers.
                              </p>
<p>Since 2014, Crédit Agricole CIB has set up an action plan known
                              as the Customer Recommendation Index, the aim of which is to assess
                              if the Bank's products and services fully meet its customers' expectations,
                              and therefore to better gauge the quality of the customer relationship.
                              Interviews have been conducted to find out if our products and services
                              fully meet our customers' expectations, to assess the quality of our
                              organisation, to identify areas of improvement for our distribution
                              processes, and to create a management tool to motivate our sales people
                              and make them more aware of certain weaknesses.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Malfunctions</h4>
<p>The entire compliance system (organisation, procedures, training
                              programmes) creates an environment conducive to the strengthening
                              of ex ante control. Nonetheless, when preventive measures fail and
                              a malfunction occurs, Crédit Agricole CIB has specific procedures
                              in place to ensure that these malfunctions are:

<p>Centralisation of malfunctions cases in the reporting process,
                              as described in the specific governance text, allows to be aware at
                              the highest level of the company, of the Bank's exposure to non-compliance
                              risk. Therefore, when an employee reasonably establishes the existence
                              of a malfunction in the field of compliance, he must tell his supervisor
                              who informs the operational representatives and the Compliance, Permanent
                              Control and Legal functions' officials depending on the subject. The
                              system is completed by an alert mechanism allowing employees, if they
                              find an abnormality in the malfunction treatment which they consider
                              is due to a deficiency of, or pressure exercised by, their manager,
                              or if they think they are being submitted to pressure, active or passive,
                              that may lead them to cause a dysfunction or to dissimulate it, to
                              inform their compliance manager and/or, if they so wish, their manager's
                              direct superior of the situation. The state of the dysfunction is
                              monitored by the Global Compliance Department which will submit it
                              to the Compliance Management Committee.

                              and to ensure compliance with international sanctions.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole Group has taken account of the requirements linked
                              to the transposition into internal law of the third European Directive
                              2005-1960/EC of 26 October 2005 about preventing the use of the financial
                              system to launder money and finance terrorism. A risk mapping was
                              done and implemented by every business lines of the Group, within
                              the framework of the vigilance system adapted to the level of the
                              identified risk, both when entering into relationship and during the
                              entire business relationship. Crédit Agricole CIB has continued to
                              adapt and improve the existing system as part of the implementation
                              of the fourth Directive 2015/849, voted by the European Parliament
                              on 20 May 2015, for the requirements which have been transposed into
                              French law.

<p>Therefore, when entering into any relationship, the required customer
                              ID checks are a first filter to prevent money laundering. This preventative
                              measure relies on knowledge of the client and of the beneficial owners,
                              completed by data research through specialised databases. It also
                              takes into account the purpose and intended nature of the business
                              transaction. During the business relationship, there is an appropriate
                              vigilance proportionate to the identified level of risks. For that
                              purpose, the Group's employees may use computer tools for client profiling
                              and for detecting unusual transactions.

<p>The fight against terrorism financing and the mechanism for ensuring
                              the respect of international sanctions means, in particular, a constant

                              during the relationship, with a list of sanctions as well as the monitoring

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB Group has also taken on the commitments of
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. Group in the field of tax, as tax approaches
                              are a key component of corporate social responsibility. Therefore,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB and all of its subsidiaries adhere to all tax
                              regulations (ETNC, FATCA, AEOI, etc.) in place in all countries and
                              apply the commitments the Group has entered into. As such, they do
                              not provide assistance or encouragement to customers in breaking laws
                              and/or infringing tax regulations, nor do they facilitate or tolerate
                              transactions whose benefit for the customer lies in the non-disclosure
                              of circumstances to the tax authorities. As part of its global strategy,
                              following assistance of its customers on compliance with their tax
                              duties under the Automatic Exchange of Information set up within the

                              </h4>
<p>Since 2011, Crédit Agricole CIB has used a procedure to calculate
                              greenhouse gas emissions said to be financed by a financial institution.
                              The procedure was developed at its request by the Chair in Quantitative
                              Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris Dauphine University and
                              École polytechnique. This innovative P9XCA methodology has, since
                              2014, been recommended for corporate and investment banks in the financial
                              sector guide to "Conducting a greenhouse gas emissions audit" published
                              by the Agency for Environment and Energy Management, the Observatory
                              on Corporate Social Responsibility and the Bilan Carbone Association.
                              </p>
<p>It enables Crédit Agricole CIB to calculate, without multiple counting,
                              the order of magnitude of the emissions financed and map them according
                              to sector and geographical location. The method involves allocating
                              greenhouse gas emissions to economic players according to their ability
                              (and economic interest in so doing) to reduce them (allocation "by
                              challenge" rather than the usual "by scope" allocation, see sector
                              guide). This methodology makes it possible to map the carbon challenge
                              by sector and geographic location and guide the choice of sectors
                              for the development of sector-wide CSR policies. It was also used
                              in the methodologies and calculations relating to transitional climate
                              risks presented below.

<p>In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related
                              Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a sensitivity analysis to climate risks

<p>Absence of any new mitigation measures in the first few years (business

                              mitigation measures in an attempt to still meet the 2°C target. The
                              sudden nature of these measures and the necessary magnitude due to
                              the delayed implementation mean that they cannot be anticipated by
                              economic players.
                              </p>
<p>Each scenario led to a climate trajectory and to a carbon price
                              level in line with the scope of the mitigation measures. Research
                              has therefore been carried out into the potential impact on the profitability
                              of companies which are Investment Banking clients both as regards
                              the physical climate risk and the transitional climate risk.
                              </p>
<p>As regards the physical risk, the average potential impact on the
                              value added of companies has been considered to directly reflect the
                              impact of global warming on the global GNP as generally estimated
                              in the literature (without taking into account, at this stage, the
                              different impacts according to sector and country).
                              </p>
<p>For the transitional risk, the potential vulnerability of companies
                              was assessed using the emissions allocated to the economic players
                              in the sectors and countries defined in P9XCA (in the by-challenge
                              version) and correlated with their added value. Valued at the carbon
                              price selected for each scenario, these emissions make it possible
                              to provide an initial economic assessment of the carbon challenge
                              for each macro-sector and country. Based on several studies concluding
                              that a controlled energy transition would not damage growth (see below),
                              it was considered that the carbon challenge would impact companies
                              differently depending on their ability to anticipate and therefore
                              the maturity of the adaptation measures.
                              </p>
<p>These calculations are by necessity approximate but provide insight
                              into the orders of magnitude and make it possible to compare the potential
                              impacts on sectors and countries depending on the scenarios and timescales
                              used. The calculations show the transitional climate risk in the "sudden
                              progress" scenario as the main medium-term risk, while underlining
                              the strong increase in the physical climate risk over time, notably
                              in the scenario involving no new mitigation measures.
                              </p>
<p>They also provide an initial macro-economic insight into climate
                              risks by highlighting the main risk areas (sectors and countries)
                              according to the various scenarios and timescales. For the medium-term
                              transitional risk, identified as the main potential risk, a complementary
                              micro-economic approach has been developed which seeks to differentiate
                              it at individual counterparty level.

<p>For financial players, the transitional climate risk arises mainly
                              from the uncertain return from their customers' investments and changes
                              in the financial models which result from the changes in the economic
                              environment brought about by initiatives against global warming (introduction
                              of a carbon price, regulatory changes).
                              </p>
<p>An OECD study published in May 2017, "Investing in Climate, Investing
                              in Growth", concluded that a controlled energy transition is favourable
                              to the economic growth of the G20 countries, backing up the conclusions
                              of a study by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency
                              (ADEME) in 2016 (An electricity mix from 100% renewable sources? Technical
                              summary and macro-economic evaluation summary) for France. It would
                              seem, therefore, that the impact of the energy transition will not
                              necessarily be negative for economic players. Rather, it will be important
                              to be able to identify the winners and the losers in this major change.
                              </p>
<p>The potential impact of the energy transition on the financial
                              performance of a company would therefore seem to depend on both the
                              potential sensitivity of the company to the transition (due to its
                              business sector and geographical location) and its ability to manage
                              the transition (level of anticipation and strategy).
                              </p>
<p>The economic player's potential sensitivity to the transition challenge
                              depends on how much pressure it is under. This, in turn, depends on
                              the extent to which it operates independently of the measures it puts
                              in place. It is a measure of the extent of the potential positive
                              or negative impact of the energy transition for the economic player,
                              which can be described as a combination of two factors: the extent
                              to which the challenges will affect the sector, based on the sector's
                              carbon intensity; and the importance the country in question places
                              on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
                              </p>
<p>The ability to manage the transition challenge determines whether
                              or not the economic player has the right strategy and has taken the
                              right measures to enable it to gain from the energy transition. It
                              seems to us that this level of "maturity" should be assessed relative
                              to the business sector, across all geographical locations.
                              </p>
<p>A medium-term transition risk index has therefore been calculated
                              for the Bank's corporate customer groups using a combination of three
                              factors:

<p>For each customer group, the transition risk index is calculated
                              by adding together these three factors. The index is positive when
                              the counterparty demonstrates above-average preparedness and is negative
                              if it does not. The more the customer stands out from its peers, the
                              more the sector is considered to be at risk, and the more the country
                              has committed to a rapid energy transition, the higher the absolute
                              value of the index.
                              </p>
<p>Thus, a player in the Energy or Transport sectors in a country
                              committed to significantly lowering emissions will have more to gain
                              or lose than a player in a sector which is less affected in a country
                              with lower greenhouse gas reduction demands. The extent to which this
                              actor is affected will depend on its ability to adapt its strategy
                              and economic model to the new situation.
                              </p>

                              </h4>
<p>The CSR sector policies are the first-line tool for managing environmental
                              and social risks, particularly the transitional climate risk. These
                              policies cover the macro-sectors of energy and transport, which account
                              for over 80% of the carbon footprint caused by our finance. In particular,
                              the policies on fossil fuels do not usually include transactions relating
                              to activities which seem the least compatible with the developments
                              expected in light of the energy transition and thus potentially the
                              most risky as regards the transitional climate risk.
                              </p>
<p>The transitional risk index completes this approach by making it
                              possible to identify customers for which additional analyses seem
                              necessary in view of their exposure to the transition risk and management
                              of this risk. This approach applies to all sectors and all countries.

                              </h4>
<p>Financing the energy transition represents a major societal challenge,
                              as highlighted in the latest assessment report by the Intergovernmental
                              Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC estimates the volume of climate-related
                              financing at approximately USD 350 billion per year, with most of
                              this amount targeting mitigation measures. The private sector accounts
                              for approximately two thirds of the total financing.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB actively contributes to meeting this objective:</p>

<p>Financing renewable energies is an integral part of Crédit Agricole

                              financing. The Bank first entered this sector in 1997 by financing
                              the first wind farms, and in 2008 it financed a solar energy project
                              in Spain. The Project Finance business line has financed a total of
                              379 wind farms generating more than 20,000 MW and 125 solar farms
                              representing more than 4,800 MW in installed capacity (including 114
                              photovoltaic plants for 4,300 MW and 11 solar thermal power plants
                              for 500 MW).

                              Bonds, create a link between market products and the infrastructures
                              needed to build a more equitable society. They also provide investors

                              Crédit Agricole CIB was involved in structuring this transaction,

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's Financial Management Department supports

                              in its synthetic securitisations. Synthetic securitisation involves
                              transferring the counterparty credit risk linked to loans to an investor
                              without transferring the assets. This makes it possible to release
                              the regulatory equity, which can then be reallocated to other financing
                              operations.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, Crédit Agricole CIB implemented synthetic securitisation

                              some of the capital released in this way in the amount of USD 2 billion
                              in finance with an environmental impact such as developments in renewable
                              energy, minimising the carbon footprint and water reprocessing.

                              </h4>
<p>Since 2011, in addition to the standard greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations
                              shown in the "Limiting our direct environmental footprint" section,
                              an estimation of the Bank's financing and investment carbon footprint
                              is now in place. This is obtained using the P9XCA methodology.
                              </p>
<p>The recorded order of magnitude was the equivalent of 100 Mt of
                              CO<sub>2</sub> . This induced footprint, approximately 1,000 times
                              greater than the estimated operating emissions for Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, reflects the carbon intensity of the financed activities and
                              demonstrates the Bank's active role in financing the global economy.
                              </p>
<p>The CSR sector policies and the transition risk index help both
                              reduce the climate risks of Crédit Agricole CIB (see above) and improve
                              climate-related results. The transition risk index makes it possible
                              to develop a generalised consideration of this matter across all sectors
                              and countries. Reflecting the positioning of each customer as regards
                              the energy transition, this approach appears to be both more precise
                              and more relevant than one that is only based on successive sector-based
                              exclusions.
                              </p>
<p>While it may seem difficult to calculate the alignment of the Bank's
                              operations with the Paris climate agreement or a particular climate
                              scenario, given the number and variety of operations and customers,
                              good climate finance performance bears witness to the work done by
                              Crédit Agricole CIB in this area.
                              </p>
<p>In terms of number of loans, renewable energy represented over
                              50% of electricity generation project finance in 2017. This finance
                              enabled the construction of over 3,300 MW of installed capacity of
                              renewable energy (wind and solar).

                              Agricole CIB was involved in the securing of USD 70 billion on climate
                              financing between December 2015 and December 2017. The Bank's success
                              on the Green and Sustainability Bonds market in 2016 and the end of
                              2017 was one of the major factors in achieving this objective.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">3.5 REPORTING
                              ON OUR CLIMATE ACTION
                              </h4>
<p>Financial institutions, particularly In the private sector, are
                              faced with a major dilemma regarding the disclosure of their actions.
                              On the one hand, they are bound by a duty of confidentiality towards
                              their customers. On the other, public Interest groups continue to
                              demand greater transparency and comparability. Other major hindrances
                              to accurate reporting of actions performed are the large numbers of
                              customers and transactions, the low relevance of international economic
                              classifications to climate Issues and the wide range of bank loans.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is nevertheless making major efforts In terms
                              of transparency by publishing Its environmental and social evaluation
                              and exclusion criteria In its sector-wide CSR policies and presenting
                              its climate risk assessment approach and tools. In a spirit of Corporate
                              Social Responsibility, this transparent approach meets the recommendations
                              of TCFD and the requirements of Article 173 of the law on energy transition
                              for green growth.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB encourages Its customers to also engage In
                              this transparency approach. This is embodied in the Equator Principles,
                              which contain an obligation for customers to publish certain information.
                              This Is also true of the Green Bond Principles, which aim to increase
                              transparency on the market by encouraging issuers to regularly publish
                              their reporting on fund allocation and on environmental and social
                              Impact measures for financed projects.
                              </p>
<p>Based on these reports published by Issuers and on publicly-available
                              transaction information, Crédit Agricole CIB analyses all of Its projects
                              financed by the green, sustainability and social bonds. It was concluded
                              on the basis of these analyses that at the end of January 2017, 90%
                              of bonds present on the green, sustainability and social bond market
                              (representing a total outstanding amount of USD 190 billion) were
                              financing projects with an environmental purpose. The breakdown by
                              sector for these environmental projects is as follows:

<p>Renewable energy and energy efficiency represent the vast majority
                              of the projects financed by green and sustainability bonds, which
                              are themselves broken down as shown below:

<p>In 2013, Crédit Agricole CIB developed a new product: the "Crédit
                              Agricole CIB Green Notes". The Green Notes are bonds or any other
                              financial instrument issued by Crédit Agricole CIB whose funds raised
                              are dedicated to funding environmental projects.
                              </p>
<p>For its Green Notes, Crédit Agricole CIB has followed the principles
                              laid down by the Green Bond Principles which are voluntary principles
                              for the formulation of green bonds and for market guidance. Green
                              Bond Principles are offered by the major green bonds arranging banks,
                              including Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              </p>

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Second opinion</h4>
<p>In April 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB sought a second opinion from
                              the non-financial rating agency Sustainalytics on the issue of green
                              notes. Sustainalytics experts approved the methods used to select
                              the projects to be included in the Green portfolio, as well as the
                              relevance of the chosen sectors to climate change prevention.

                              </h4>
<p>Since 2010, the Sustainable Banking team has been supporting customers
                              with social or environmental projects in line with the four areas
                              of excellence selected by Crédit Agricole Group: farming and food
                              production, housing, health and the ageing population and the energy
                              and environment economy.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB helped a customer set up an investment fund
                              dedicated to developing renewable energy infrastructures in emerging
                              countries. This investment fund generates a medium to long term return
                              by encouraging private investors to support a portfolio of renewable
                              energy development projects and offers different investment tranches
                              with varying risk/return profiles. Crédit Agricole CIB was involved
                              in all stages of the project, from design to putting investors into
                              contact with the project owners. As access to energy facilitates economic
                              activity and improves living conditions, this project has a positive
                              impact on the economic development of the regions involved.

                              </h4>
<p>Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) seeks to reconcile an investment's
                              economic performance with its social and environmental impact by providing
                              financing to companies and public-sector entities that contribute
                              to sustainable development, regardless of the economic sector. By
                              influencing the governance and behaviour of market participants, SRI
                              promotes a responsible economy.
                              </p>
<p>This responsible development concept has been extended to product
                              marketing and social policy.
                              </p>
<p>Indosuez Wealth (Group) has developed a specific action plan which

                              development issues, i.e. combating climate change, biodiversity protection
                              and respect for human rights.

                              PROTECTION (INDICATOR 2E)
                              </h4>
<p>Since it exercises a services activity and is located in urban
                              environments, the Bank does not have a significant direct impact on
                              biodiversity.
                              </p>
<p>However, the activities it finances may in some cases affect biodiversity.
                              In its CSR sectoral policies, Crédit Agricole CIB therefore introduced
                              analytical and exclusionary criteria based on biodiversity protection,
                              with particular attention paid to important areas based on this criterion.
                              Critical adverse impacts on the most sensitive protected areas, such
                              as and wetlands covered by the Ramsar Convention, constitute exclusionary
                              criteria under these policies, for example.

<p>Since 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB has been mapping the sectors and
                              geographical regions which are most exposed to water access and pollution
                              issues. Crédit Agricole CIB has included this new analysis criterion
                              in its CSR scoring system, described below.

                              TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS (INDICATOR 3E)
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB fully endorses the values of the United Nations
                              Global Compact, of which Crédit Agricole is a signatory. This particularly
                              concerns human rights and labour standards. Crédit Agricole S.A. has
                              signed several specific charters in addition to these general principles,
                              including the Diversity Charter in 2008, the Human Rights Charter
                              in 2009 and the Responsible Purchasing Charter in 2010.
                              </p>
<p>Employee-related actions are detailed in the section "Developing
                              people and the societal ecosystem" while actions linked to subcontractors
                              and suppliers are covered in the section on "Strengthening trust".
                              </p>
<p>As with climate and biodiversity matters, however, the indirect
                              impacts involving the financed activities appear as most significant.
                              They are assessed and managed as shown below. The Bank's CSR sector
                              policies refer specifically to the International Labour Organisation
                              (ILO) fundamental conventions, and the International Finance Corporation
                              (IFC) performance standards.
                              </p>
<p>Since 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB maps the sectors and geographical
                              regions which are most exposed to risks of human rights violations
                              in both their own operations and within their supply chains. Crédit
                              Agricole CIB has included this new criteria of analysis in its CSR
                              scoring system described below.
                              </p>
<p>In an effort to limit the negative Impacts on populations affected
                              by the projects it finances, the Bank has made two applications to
                              the Equator Principles Association concerning the obligation to obtain,
                              in all countries, the free, advance and informed consent of the indigenous
                              peoples affected and the creation of a grievance management structure.
                              Crédit Agricole CIB co-led the working group which made recommendations
                              on the matter of indigenous populations affected to the General Meeting
                              of the Equator Principles Association in November 2017.

<p>The environmental and social impacts resulting from the financing
                              activity appear to be substantially greater than the Bank's direct
                              environmental footprint. Taking these indirect impacts into account
                              is one of the main sustainable development challenges for Crédit Agricole
                              CIB. The system which manages these environmental and social business
                              risks is based on three pillars:

<p>Environmental and social risks are first assessed and managed by
                              the account manager. Account managers are backed by a network of local
                              correspondents, who provide the necessary support in each regional
                              Project Finance structuring centre and remain in constant communication
                              with a co-ordination unit. It comprises operating staff from the Project

                              implementation of the Equator Principles. It manages the network of
                              local correspondents and implements specialised training for participants.

<p>Group Economic Research (ECO) is an integral part of Crédit Agricole

                              of transactions and customers by contributing its expertise on environmental
                              and technical issues, thereby making it possible to fine-tune the

<p>Even though its corporate client base comprises mostly SMEs, Wealth

                              covers these issues, supported by a special opinion if necessary.

                              Principles
                              </h4>
<p>The Equator Principles were developed in response to limitations
                              and triggers related to project financing, as defined by the Basel
                              Committee on Banking Supervision. Although they cannot always be applied
                              in their current state to other types of financing, they nevertheless
                              represent a useful methodological framework for recognising and preventing
                              environmental and social impacts in cases where the financing appears
                              to be linked to the construction of a specific industrial asset (plant,
                              transport infrastructure, etc.).

                              </h4>
<p>The CSR sector policies published by Crédit Agricole CIB explain
                              the social and environmental criteria included in its financing policies.
                              These criteria relate mainly to the issues of concern to civil society
                              that appear to be the most relevant for a corporate and investment
                              bank, particularly those relating to human rights, fighting climate
                              change and preserving biodiversity. The goal of the CSR sector policies
                              is therefore to clarify the non-financial principles and rules relating
                              to financing and investments in the corresponding sectors, in accordance
                              with the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group policy.
                              </p>
<p>The current sector policies and their implementation are described
                              on the website.

<p>From 2013, Crédit Agricole CIB introduced a CSR scoring system
                              for all corporate clients designed to complement its system for assessing
                              and managing the environmental and social risks of transactions. Clients
                              are rated each year on a scale that includes three levels (Advanced,
                              Compliance and Sensitive), with these ratings based on:

<p>This scoring system is evolving following the service contract
                              signed with a non-financial rating agency. The tests conducted in
                              2016 and 2017 on the use of ratings from this agency will result in
                              a CSR scoring system being introduced in 2018 with three due diligence
                              levels: light, standard and reinforced. These three levels of due
                              diligence are described on the Bank's website.

                              </h4>
<p>The human resources policy of the Group and Crédit Agricole CIB
                              is to ensure that each position in the organisation is held by a motivated
                              employee whose skills and performance meet the requirements and challenges
                              of his or her position, but also to prepare for the future. Thus,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB deploys a policy of career management to enable
                              each employee, regardless of its level in the organisation, to expand
                              its professional experience in a constructive manner, but also to
                              develop skills that will be necessary in the future.
                              </p>
<p>This approach is harmonised and globally shared to reflect the
                              international nature of Crédit Agricole CIB's operations and its corporate
                              culture.

                              and integration
                              </h4>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB rolled out its CACIB Global Induction
                              Programme, to help new employees integrate into the Company. The programme
                              introduces them to the different Crédit Agricole CIB business lines
                              and the Bank's culture.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB intranet has a dedicated area wherein a
                              large number of documents aiding in the integration process are available.
                              Digital resources are also available on the Bank's international training
                              portal, HRE-Learning. An individual programme of mandatory training
                              courses is in place to develop and promote the compliance and risks
                              culture, helping new employees to adopt the correct conduct expected
                              of them in regulatory matters. This step is vital to limit the Bank's
                              risk exposure. Depending on the business line, new employees may also
                              follow additional training courses linked to their activity. Optional
                              modules are also available on the portal to help them successfully
                              take up their new position.
                              </p>
<p>During their first year within the Bank, new arrivals are also
                              invited to take part in an induction event to gain a better understanding
                              of the interaction between the Bank's different business lines and
                              to meet their peers who have recently joined Crédit Agricole CIB teams.
                              In 2017, four editions were organised: three in Paris for new employees
                              from France and the EMEA region and one in Hong Kong for employees
                              in the Asia-Pacific region. Since its inception in 2016, more than
                              900 participants have taken part in this integration event.
                              </p>
<p>Depending on their location and business line, new hires may also
                              be required to participate in specific integration programmes.

<p>Each year, the appraisal and objectives meetings provide an opportunity
                              to take stock of individual and collective performance and the employees'
                              achievements and development needs.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, the appraisal and objectives meetings were formalised
                              in a new version of PeopleCare, Crédit Agricole S.A. Group's career
                              management tool. Training sessions were offered to Crédit Agricole
                              CIB employees to provide them with a better understanding of the new
                              ergonomics and new features of the tool.
                              </p>
<p>Within the framework of this worldwide campaign in 2017, 99% of
                              the annual assessments between employees and managers have been realised.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB employs an active training policy to meet its

<p>The worldwide training portal, HRE-learning, launched in 2016,
                              accessible to all employees throughout the year, was expanded in 2017.
                              With more than 900 digital modules available, this portal offers a

                              INTERNAL MOBILITY TO ENHANCE CAREER PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYEES
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB encourages internal mobility to allow all of
                              its employees to progress within the Bank and the Crédit Agricole
                              Group. Internal mobility is favoured over external recruitment.
                              </p>
<p>MyJobs is a dedicated internal mobility portal which is available
                              to Crédit Agricole CIB in France and worldwide. It lists all of the
                              job vacancies in corporate and investment banking and the Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. Group. Crédit Agricole CIB uses various tools to support employee
                              mobility: mobility committees, business line forums, HR interviews,
                              CV workshops and speed interviews. These tools and initiatives create
                              a more cross-disciplinary approach and develop the mobility culture.
                              </p>
<p>The fourth edition of the "Forum des métiers" [Business lines forum]
                              based around the topic "Osez la mobilité" [Dare to achieve mobility]
                              was held in France in October 2017. Employees were invited to interact
                              with Crédit Agricole CIB's various business lines and to attend conferences.
                              More than 152 employees were able to participate in the "Self-marketing"
                              workshop led by Véronique Préaux-Cobti. In addition, the "En route
                              pour la mobilité" [Towards mobility] leaflet, published in France
                              in 2016, was distributed to employees internationally. This leaflet
                              contains practical tips to help them prepare for a successful move
                              within the Company and an overview of the support structures in place.
                              Finally, a new programme "Déclic mobilité" [Unlock mobility], led
                              by a firm specialised in professional coaching, was rolled out to
                              allow employees to reflect on their career plans and to kick-start
                              their career goals. In 2017, 30 employees benefited from this scheme.

                              AND DEVELOPING TALENTS
                              </h4>
<p>At Crédit Agricole CIB, the members of the Management Committee,
                              managers and Human Resources have been working to identify and manage
                              talent for several years now. Part of the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group
                              policy, it aims to retain and develop the capabilities of employees
                              with potential and to ensure succession plans for strategic positions
                              at the Bank.
                              </p>
<p>Since 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB's Talent Management policy has
                              been structured around three categories based on identification criteria
                              approved by Executive Management: Rising Talents, Advanced Talents
                              and Future Leaders. Each year, the executive committees of the business
                              lines work with Human Resources to review the talent lists worldwide.
                              Diversity is a particularly important factor in this review.
                              </p>
<p>The Bank's talents are offered special development opportunities
                              which combine Group-wide programmes and specific Crédit Agricole CIB
                              programmes.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, 61 Rising Talents took part in the fourth My Way programme
                              in France and worldwide. This programme brings together the employee,
                              his or her manager and HR manager to discuss the employee's development
                              plan and career path.
                              </p>
<p>Indosuez Wealth Management also offers the My Way programme to
                              its Rising Talents from its different locations.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, 42 Advanced Talents from Crédit Agricole CIB attended
                              a workshop on intercultural issues. The attendees were able to decipher
                              the impact that multicultural relations have on cooperation and management
                              while sharing their experiences.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Promoting
                              and managing employees with respect and responsibility
                              </h4>
<p>In a complex and constantly-changing environment, it is vital that
                              the Crédit Agricole CIB strategy is properly disseminated. The managers
                              play a key role in implementing the strategy at all levels of the
                              Bank, mobilising the teams and developing the skills of their employees.
                              Since 2012, Crédit Agricole CIB has therefore deployed the Management
                              Academy, a training programme for all managers in France and worldwide,
                              which aims to develop a shared managerial culture. In 2017, a new
                              concept of the Management Academy, structured around three levels
                              of expertise, was proposed to the managers of Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              The first level, Novice Learner is open to all employees who then
                              have free access to digital modules on managerial topics via the Bank's
                              international training portal. The second and third levels, Expert
                              Learners and Master Learners, combine digital and classroom training
                              modules focused on four skill sets: relational intelligence, mobilising
                              people, implementing strategy and steering action. These levels are
                              addressed respectively to new managers, operational managers, experienced
                              managers and senior managers.
                              </p>
<p>In France in 2017, 25 sessions were held and 198 managers attended
                              a Management Academy training session. Similar sessions have also
                              been rolled out at Crédit Agricole CIB's main locations.

<p>As a committed and responsible employer, Crédit Agricole CIB wants
                              its organisation to reflect the rich diversity of society and therefore
                              makes every effort to treat every employee fairly.
                              </p>
<p>To ensure its employees are properly equipped to understand diversity
                              issues, Crédit Agricole CIB set up a Diversity Academy, open to all
                              in France and worldwide, on its HRE-Learning training portal. The
                              Diversity Academy develops employees' openness, listening skills,
                              self-awareness and awareness of others through digital modules on
                              topics such as interculturality, gender and disability.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also holds mandatory training courses in some
                              of its locations to promote diversity and prevent discrimination,
                              such as in Germany and India.

                              GENDER EQUALITY AT WORK
                              </h4>
<p>Convinced that diversity is the key to promoting performance and
                              innovation, for several years now the Bank has been implementing a
                              proactive diversity policy. In order to identify the main issues and
                              measure the effectiveness of its actions, Crédit Agricole CIB monitors
                              gender distribution indicators throughout the year. Following the
                              steps taken by the Bank's Management Committee, which met in July
                              2016 during a special seminar dedicated to diversity and performance
                              issues, in 2017 the members of Crédit Agricole CIB's Executive Committee
                              set a number of diversity-related goals to be met between now and
                              the end of 2019 within their respective business lines.
                              </p>
<p>This year, the Bank also launched a global mentoring programme
                              in France and internationally to support some 40 employees identified
                              by the business lines, the mentees, in their development and to help
                              them to achieve greater visibility. This programme will allow mentees
                              to exchange and benefit from the experience of mentors, members of
                              the Executive Committees and Business Line Management Committees,
                              in a confidential and caring environment. A digital training and a
                              classroom workshop were offered in France to support the mentors.
                              A wider roll-out of this scheme may be considered at the end of this
                              pilot phase.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole Crédit Agricole CIB also supports gender equality
                              networks which have been set up at its different locations by female
                              employees, such as CWEEN, launched in India in 2008, Potentielles
                              in France in 2010, CACIB Women's Network (CWN) in New York also in
                              2010, SPRING in London in 2015, RISE in Hong Kong in 2016, and WING
                              in Tokyo in 2017. This year has also seen diversity networks launch
                              voluntary mentoring initiatives.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also implements leadership programmes for its
                              female employees. In 2017, 43 women took part in the "Leadership au
                              féminin" [Female leadership] training in France. A 2-day pilot session
                              was held for 14 female employees from the EMEA region who met in London
                              in June and in Paris in November. The Eve seminar, offering the opportunity
                              to meet other attendees from other major groups and share experiences,
                              was offered to 19 Crédit Agricole CIB employees in France and Asia.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, as every year, Diversity Week was held in France and abroad.
                              This event allowed employees to attend conferences and awareness workshops.
                              The 2017 edition saw initiatives proposed in Paris, New York, Hong
                              Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, London, Frankfurt, Madrid Milan and Stockholm.

                              </h4>
<p>To help its employees find a good work/life balance following the
                              move the Bank provided support measures, such as moving grants, travel
                              grants and new work organisation options, mainly through a number
                              of collective agreements.
                              </p>
<p>The teleworking agreement signed in France in late 2015 has enabled
                              Crédit Agricole CIB to offer this new working practice. As a result,
                              at 31 December 2017, almost 700 employees were working from home for
                              one day a week, even two days in some cases.
                              </p>
<p>Flexible working arrangements were also introduced in other European
                              countries in which Crédit Agricole CIB operates. An international
                              roll-out of this initiative is also being considered.
                              </p>
<p>Teleworking was launched at Indosuez Wealth Management in 2017
                              thanks to the signing of a collective agreement in France. Nearly
                              50% of employees benefit from one or two days of teleworking per week.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its policy to promote gender equality, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB is also running parenting initiatives in France and worldwide.
                              2017 saw a strengthening of employees schemes related to maternity,
                              paternity and adoption, particularly in London and Taiwan. In France,
                              50 female employees attended workshops on the topic of finding a balance
                              between work and motherhood. Similar sessions have also been rolled
                              out in Italy. Crédit Agricole CIB held a family day in Hong Kong welcoming
                              more than 65 children of employees.
                              </p>
<p>Convinced that the donation of rest days is deeply embedded in
                              the Bank's values and social issues, Crédit Agricole CIB has set up
                              a system for donating rest days to colleagues. A collective agreement
                              was concluded on 10 July 2017, unanimously signed by the unions. While
                              the legal scheme is currently authorised only to provide care for
                              a child who is seriously ill, Crédit Agricole CIB plans to extend
                              the donation of rest days to the employee's spouse or partner in a
                              civil partnership and also considers the situation of employees' dependent
                              parents or grandparents. The first rest day donation campaign was
                              held from 4 to 31 December 2017. To initiate the scheme, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB credited 30 days to the "Banque de jours solidaires" [Solidarity
                              days account] used to collect rest day donations.
                              </p>
<p>In France, Crédit Agricole CIB also provides, for its employees
                              in and outside the Paris region, 41 places in intercompany nurseries
                              (through a partnership with the Babilou nationwide nurseries network),
                              which are allocated based on social criteria. Parents (fathers or
                              mothers) may also receive authorised paid leave on the first day of
                              school in order to accompany their children.

                              studies, specially adapted computer equipment (screens, special software
                              for employees with visual impairment), use of the Tadéo telephone
                              aid for hearing-impaired employees, introduction of working from home
                              and developing the use of sign language translation for conferences
                              and training courses. This individual support can also take the form
                              of tailored training, psychological monitoring, or coaching.
                              </p>
<p>Preventative health and disability awareness events are organised
                              throughout the year. They aim to inform employees about the different
                              illnesses and to offer better support for employees with disabilities.
                              The Disability Employment Week was held at the Bank's offices in France
                              from 13 to 17 November 2017 with the theme "Innovation". On this occasion,
                              the brochure "Shall we talk about disability differently?" was distributed
                              and hearing screening was offered to more than 180 employees. Four
                              creativity workshops also allowed 30 employees to come together to
                              reflect together on how to change how disability is perceived. In
                              addition to its direct initiatives to raise awareness about the employment
                              of people with disabilities, Crédit Agricole CIB delegates services
                              to the sheltered and disability-friendly employment sector ("Entreprises
                              Adaptées" and "Établissements et Services d'Aide par le Travail")
                              in particular for the maintenance of printers.

<p>The wage policy is key to Crédit Agricole Group's strategic human
                              resources management. Crédit Agricole CIB's remuneration policy is
                              based on principles of fairness, performance incentives in line with
                              risk management and the sharing of the Company's values. This policy
                              is deployed taking into account the economic, social and competitive
                              context of the markets in which the Bank operates, as well as applicable
                              legal and regulatory obligations.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB places a great importance on the principle
                              of equal treatment at work. Provisions can be made locally to reduce
                              possible gender wage gaps, for example as in France under the agreement
                              on gender equality at work.

<p>The Bank contributes to the funding of health cover programmes
                              in many countries in order to offer its employees access to healthcare.
                              Crédit Agricole CIB also places significant importance on protecting
                              the families of employees who die or are absent from work, and fully

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB was a forerunner for retirement planning in
                              many countries with its employer-assisted savings plan. In France,
                              Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, this type
                              of scheme has been in place for over 20 years.
                              </p>
<p>Through its employee savings schemes, employees share in the Company's
                              results and performance. Since 2016, the profitsharing agreement in
                              France has incorporated the Bank's CSR indicator, FReD, to take account
                              of the joint commitment of the Company and its employees to the success
                              of the CSR policy. Worldwide, employees are regularly offered the
                              opportunity to share in capital increase operations.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Providing
                              employees with a working environment and working conditions that ensure
                              their health and safety
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB considers quality of life in the workplace
                              as a driver of fulfilment and performance and as being essential to
                              its effectiveness. The Bank provides employees in France and abroad
                              with training in the preventing of stress, including on its HRE-Learning
                              portal at the Management Academy and Diversity Academy. In France,
                              any courses in this area requested during appraisal sessions or at
                              other times of the year by employees and managers are systematically
                              approved. En 2017, 66 employees took part in the training on "Savoir
                              équilibrer pression et efficience" [Finding the balance between pressure
                              and efficiency] and 16 managers took part in the training on "Le stress
                              de ses collaborateurs et le sien" [Your and your employees' stress].
                              </p>
<p>To fight against psychosocial risks, Crédit Agricole CIB provides
                              an anonymous and confidential psychological support service to employees
                              in France with a toll-free number.
                              </p>
<p>The employees can also share any observations they have with the
                              Human Resources Department, including their own HR manager. As part
                              of the efforts to prevent psychosocial risks, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              encourages all those concerned within the Company to play an active
                              role and report any difficulties that might be encountered by employees
                              (senior management, managers, workplace health unit, social workers,
                              human resources, employee representatives and employees).
                              </p>
<p>Throughout the year, Crédit Agricole CIB also holds events on health-related
                              issues at its various locations: medical check-ups, training in first
                              aid and the use of a defibrillator, free-of-charge screening, vaccination
                              campaigns, blood donations, advice on ergonomics, nutrition workshops
                              and relaxation sessions.

                              </h4>
<p>The Group promotes dynamic and constructive social dialogue with
                              its employees and their representatives. This commitment, which plays
                              a vital role in the smooth running of the Bank, can take several different
                              forms: direct discussions, social surveys and questionnaires, information
                              disseminated continuously on Group events and its strategy in France
                              and worldwide, the use of collaborative tools and responsible social
                              dialogue.
                              </p>
<p>The social climate within the Group is the result of an ongoing
                              dialogue between management, employees and their representatives,
                              when in place locally, while respecting the values fostered by the
                              Group.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB keeps a watchful eye on the deployment of a
                              constructive social dialogue, which facilitates the conclusion of
                              a certain number of collective agreements each year, carrying real
                              commitments that reflect the Bank's social policy.
                              </p>
<p>Six agreements were signed in France during 2017, thus enriching
                              the total number of agreements in force within the Bank. These agreements
                              covered employee compensation and benefits (mandatory annual negotiations,
                              profit-sharing scheme and social welfare) as well as working conditions.
                              A new scale for determining voluntary severance pay at retirement
                              was thus instituted within Crédit Agricole CIB in order to align its
                              practices with those of the Group. The new scale is more favourable
                              than that required by law or the national collective agreement to
                              which the Bank is subject.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, in 2017, Crédit Agricole CIB held elections on the reappointment
                              of the Directors representing employees on the Board of Directors.
                              A representative from the "manager" college, a representative from
                              the "non-manager" college, as well as their alternates, were thus
                              elected by the Bank's employees.

<p>Furthermore, conferences called "InsideMeetings" are regularly

                              strategy, news, company culture, sponsorship actions, the challenges
                              of sustainable development, etc. These events provide an opportunity

<p>Having deployed their first global commitment survey in 2015, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB and Indosuez Wealth Management took part in the exercise
                              to measure the Crédit Agricole Group Commitment and Recommendation
                              Index, which was sent to all employees around the world between 19
                              September and 10 October 2017. At Crédit Agricole CIB, this initiative
                              is in line with the 2015 and 2016 commitment surveys carried and makes
                              it possible to assess the positive evolution of the results following
                              the nine global action plans already committed in 2016. This year,
                              the Crédit Agricole CIB Commitment and Recommendation Index rose by
                              three points over 2016, with 72% of favourable responses. The results
                              of this survey will identify initiatives that, in line with the nine
                              global action plans developed in 2016, will further strengthen the
                              Company's commitment and performance.

                              do not therefore have a significant impact on neighbouring and local

                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB ensures a strong presence in schools, particularly
                              through the "Capitaines d'école" led by Crédit Agricole S.A. (see
                              the "Developing people and the societal ecosystem" section in the
                              social report).
                              </p>
<p>Since 2006, Crédit Agricole CIB has also been a partner of the
                              Chair of Quantitative Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris
                              Dauphine University and École Polytechnique. This multi-disciplinary
                              project, supported from its inception by Crédit Agricole CIB, is unique
                              in that it brings together specialists in quantitative finance, mathematics
                              and sustainable development. One research area studied by this Chair
                              since 2010 involves the quantification of indirect impacts of the
                              financing and investment activities, notably greenhouse gas emissions
                              induced by the activities of the Bank's clients.
                              </p>
<p>One of the solid achievements of this research is the P9XCA methodology
                              referred to previously. Crédit Agricole CIB has played an important
                              role in disseminating this work to other financial institutions. In
                              2014, the Bank took an active role in the sector approach recommended
                              by French organisations promoting corporate social responsibility
                              (ORSE, ADEME and ABC). This approach seeks to produce a practical
                              guide listing the methodologies and tools to help the various financial
                              stakeholders (banks, insurance companies, asset managers) assess their
                              direct and indirect GHG emissions. Other research on climate risks
                              was initiated in 2017 as part of the Chair.

<p>By way of reminder, in the Paris region, nearly 70% of employees
                              have relocated to the campus in Montrouge, where they are split across
                              three buildings (Éole, Terra, Silvae), with Éole housing almost 3,000
                              people. The 30% present on the campus in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
                              are spread over two buildings (Provence, Champagne). The Eole building
                              located at the Montrouge campus has obtained an operating certification
                              (excellent level). The Terra building was again certified "HQE Exploitation"
                              with an improvement of its profile. The building was also entered
                              in the CUBE 2020 competition (Effective Building Use Competition),
                              organised by the French Institute for Building Performance with the
                              support of the Ministry of Sustainable Development. The Silvae building
                              has been awarded a "BREAM" (Very good) and "HQE Construction" (excellent
                              level) construction certification. In Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, the
                              Champagne and Provence buildings are certified as "BBC (low consumption
                              building) Renovation".

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Reducing greenhouse
                              gas emissions in the fight against climate change
                              </h4>
<p>The Crédit Agricole Group's Medium-Term 2020 Plan sets the objective
                              of reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 1 5%, measured by the
                              carbon balances at 2020 and covering the 13 entities involved in a
                              FReD approach implemented by the Group. Crédit Agricole CIB is therefore
                              logically part of this commitment. The baseline year selected was
                              201 4. To achieve the objective, the reductions include all items
                              related to energy, transport, inputs, and fixed assets.
                              </p>
<p>The results of the carbon footprint assessment carried out at the
                              end of 2014 at the head office and certain significant international
                              entities were examined in 2017 to propose areas for improvement in
                              order to reach the goal as quickly as possible.
                              </p>
<p>The approach is part of a long-term trend since, as a whole, the
                              2014 total carbon footprint has been reduced by some 16.7% compared
                              to that achieved in 2012; a positive development but less so when
                              related to the workforce for the period in question, in which case
                              the "carbon footprint per employee" was only reduced by 5.3%.
                              </p>
<p>In the 2014 financial year, the three most "energy-intensive" items
                              for a total of 82.8% were business travel, energy and fixed assets,
                              for 32%, 27.1% and 23.7% respectively.
                              </p>
<p>Actions that can be measured through indicators have therefore
                              been defined for these three items, such as reducing the electrical
                              consumption of buildings, reducing business travel (mainly the use
                              of air transport) and focusing on the planning of working time. In
                              addition to the quantitative actions chosen, regular actions to raise
                              awareness of both good day-to-day habits and better use of work tools
                              should help to consolidate the reduction objective.

                              investment in the Livelihoods Fund. This carbon investment fund provides
                              investors with carbon credits, which have a major social impact and
                              help to promote biodiversity. The Fund also finances large-scale projects
                              in the areas of reforestation, sustainable agriculture and clean energy
                              generation. These projects are implemented for and by deprived rural

<p>CFM Indosuez Wealth Management completed its eighth voluntary carbon

                              were invited to vote for the project of their choice and the 62% participation
                              rate reflects employee interest in the issues and impacts of this
                              operation. The CLEAN WATER project aiming to provide access to drinking
                              water for local people in Malawi garnered the majority of votes.

<p>Chosen for their excellence in environmental and human development,
                              EcoAct's programmes have offset a total of 5,300 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent
                              since the process launch. The CLEAN WATER project
                              aiming to provide access to drinking water for local inhabitants in
                              Malawi provides an effective solution for access to water and improving
                              sanitary conditions including the rehabilitation of wells. This allows
                              sustainable access to clean water for communities and significant
                              health benefits. In addition, families will not be required to boil
                              the water to make it safe for consumption, which means a reduction
                              in the use of firewood. This programme aims to provide drinking water
                              for 450,000 people in the two districts, which are among the least
                              served in the country, with drinking water availability estimated
                              respectively at 41% and 61%.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB does not generate significant pollution directly.
                              The Bank nevertheless devotes substantial effort to waste recycling.
                              </p>
<p>On the campuses in Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, numerous
                              actions were implemented to reduce impacts on the environment: zero
                              phytosanitary products, recycling of waste (paper and cardboard, cans,
                              plastic, ordinary industrial waste and waste from maintenance), products
                              with eco-labels for indoor cleaning, setting up a site charter to
                              sort and recycle waste as much as possible. Concerning the limitation
                              of food waste, activities are undertaken to raise awareness among
                              employees (posters, self-service fruit and vegetables).
                              </p>
<p>On a worldwide scale, data collection on recycling could still
                              be improved. However, actions have been implemented in the various
                              entities of Crédit Agricole CIB, particularly in Europe and Asia (implementation
                              of a charter of best CSR practices in the Nordic countries, replacement
                              of individual bins with centralised collection points and replacement
                              of individual printers by collective printers in Hong Kong, etc.).
                              </p>
<p>The Indosuez Wealth Management Group is also determined to reduce
                              its direct impact on the environment and continues to take actions
                              to raise the awareness of its employees to eco-friendly behaviour
                              and the implementation of resource management activities and recycling
                              (paper, ink cartridges, batteries, computer equipment). The computer
                              hardware (CPUs, printers, and screens) is now, and depending on its
                              state of operation and after being reformatted, either sold for a

<p>NB: Given the significant changes in the scope reported this year
                              as compared to the previous year (year in which Crédit Agricole CIB
                              relocated to the Paris region) any analysis of the variances in consumption
                              is meaningless.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ ELECTRICITY</h4>
<p>Since 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB has been tracking the electricity
                              consumption of all Crédit Agricole CIB Group entities, including Indosuez
                              Wealth Management entities, data centres and remote sites in the Paris
                              region. Over a total surface area of 326,000 m<sup>2</sup> , electricity
                              consumption was reported on for approximately 322,000 m<sup>2</sup> ,
                              constituting a 99% coverage ratio.
                              </p>
<p>For Crédit Agricole CIB in the Paris region, the buildings in Montrouge
                              and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines consume 1 00% "green" electricity, meaning
                              that it is generated by renewable sources of energy. An objective
                              of reducing consumption by 5% per annum has been set for the Terra,
                              Champagne and Provence buildings. For example, in 2017, more than
                              100 fan-coil units were replaced by low-energy fan coil units.
                              </p>
<p>In London, the electricity consumed is also 100% "green". In Spain,
                              the actions taken between 2014 and 2017 have helped to reduce the
                              consumption of electricity by nearly 400,000 kWh (replacement of the
                              heating system, less machines in the machine rooms, replacement of
                              neon strips by LED). Finally, progress plans are deployed locally,
                              for example in the Nordic countries (installation of LEDs and motion
                              sensors).
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ GAS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB reports on the consumption of gas of all Crédit
                              Agricole CIB Group entities, including those of Indosuez Wealth Management.
                              </p>
<p>For Crédit Agricole CIB in the Paris Region, a target of 5% reduction
                              in consumption per year is set for the Terra, Champagne and Provence
                              buildings. For example, the boilers of the Champagne and Provence
                              buildings were replaced in 2017 by more efficient condensing boilers.
                              </p>

                              </h4>
<p>This source of heating is mainly used in North America, Russia
                              and Luxembourg. There is not currently enough historical data to make
                              a comparison.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Water consumption</h4>
<p>With regard to Crédit Agricole CIB in Montrouge, the Éole and Terra
                              buildings are equipped with a rainwater recovery system and use water-saving
                              machines for cleaning the floors. In 2017, a daily water consumption
                              log was set up throughout the Evergreen campus, specifically to identify
                              non-visible leaks.

                              </h4>
<p>Given the considerable weighting of personal travel in Crédit Agricole
                              CIB's global carbon audit, business travel and commuting measures
                              constitute the main mitigating factors in the Company's direct footprint.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Company Travel
                              Plan
                              </h4>
<p>The efforts to control the transport footprint continued in 2017
                              and, on a like-for-like basis, a decrease (11%) was achieved in the
                              number of kilometres travelled for transport and business travel by
                              train and plane between 2016 and 2017.
                              </p>
<p>On the campuses in Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, the
                              actions taken to raise the awareness of employees include, among others:
                              providing electric bicycles and cars, incentives for car-pooling with
                              reserved parking spaces and video-conference equipment to reduce travel.
                              </p>
<p>The dynamics will be continued and fine-tuned through the Mobility
                              Plan described below.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Mobility Plan</h4>
<p>In compliance with its obligations, on the one hand, under the
                              Energy Transition Act and the filing of a Mobility Plan and, on the
                              other hand, under the objectives set by the Crédit Agricole Group
                              to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, Crédit Agricole CIB actively
                              participated in the launching, monitoring and completion of work covered
                              in the Mobility Plan.
                              </p>
<p>In France, commuting accounts for approximately 6% of Crédit Agricole
                              CIB's carbon footprint.
                              </p>
<p>In February 2017, a Steering Committee was formed by representatives
                              from various entities of the Crédit Agricole Group, a call for tenders
                              was launched and two suppliers were selected.
                              </p>
<p>With regard to the Saint-Quentin and Montrouge campuses, one of
                              the service providers was chosen and a Steering Committee organised
                              formed by representatives of the various entities located on these
                              campuses. The kick-off meeting was held in mid-June, and various meetings
                              were held over the course of the second half of the year, with the
                              wrap-up meeting scheduled for the end of January 2018.

                              </p>
<p>We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any
                              information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part.
                              </p>
<p>We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used,
                              based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis
                              for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance
                              would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due
                              to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to
                              information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting
                              a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come
                              to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information,
                              taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.

<p>To the shareholders,</p>
<p>Pursuant to the last paragraph of Article L. 225-37 of the French
                              Commercial Code, this report was prepared by the Board of Directors
                              as a supplement to the management report. It presents the information
                              which is required under Articles L. 225-37, L. 225-37-2 to L. 225-37-5

                              Chairman's report. It was prepared on the basis of the work of the
                              Board of Directors and its committees, the Secretariat to the Board
                              of Directors, the Human Resources Department and the procedures and

                              Officer
                              </h4>
<p>The function of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate
                              from that of Chief Executive Officer.
                              </p>
<p>The Board of Directors decided to separate these functions in May
                              2002, in accordance with Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Company's
                              Articles of Association and with French Law No. 2001-420 of 15 May
                              2001 on new economic regulations. The decision followed the decision
                              of the May 2002 General Meeting to change the Company from a société
                              anonyme (public limited company) governed by a Supervisory Board and
                              Management Board to a société anonyme governed by a Board of Directors.
                              </p>
<p>The separation of these functions is in accordance with the provisions
                              of Article L. 511-58 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which
                              stipulates that the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors
                              of a credit institution may not be held by the Chief Executive Officer.
                              </p>
<p>Mr Philippe Brassac was appointed as the Chairman of the Board
                              of Directors from 20 May 2015. The Board of Directors meeting on 9
                              May 2016 renewed his mandate for his term of office as a Director,
                              i.e. up to the end of the Ordinary General Meeting which rules on
                              the financial statements for the 2018 financial year.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with Article 15 of the Company's Articles of Association,
                              the Chairman of the Board of Directors organises and directs the Board's
                              work and ensures that the Company's bodies function correctly and
                              that the Directors are able to perform their missions. In general,
                              the Chairman possesses all the powers attributed to him by the legislation
                              in force.

<p>After receiving the opinion of the Appointments Committee, the
                              Board of Directors re-examined, in February 2017 and February 2018,
                              the list of Independent Directors and recommended this status for
                              Mrs Françoise Gri and Mrs Catherine Pourre when they were appointed
                              by the General Meeting held on 4 May 2017. Following the appointments,
                              there were five Independent Directors on 31 December 2017: Mesdames
                              DAVEU, DORLAND CLAUZEL, GRI, NOAT and POURRE.
                              </p>
<p>The proportion of Independent Directors on the Board of Directors
                              on 31 December 2017 amounted to more than a third of the Directors
                              appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. It conforms with
                              the Recommendation No. 8.3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code which states that
                              at least one third of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting
                              of Shareholders in companies, whose capital is held by a majority
                              shareholder, must be Independent Directors.
                              </p>
<p>The composition of the Board of Directors reflects the Crédit Agricole
                              Group's wish for chairmen or chief executive officers of regional
                              branches of Crédit Agricole to be represented on the Boards of Directors
                              of some of Crédit Agricole S.A.'s subsidiaries. These Directors who
                              come directly from the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group are not considered
                              to be independent because of their functions inside the Group.

                              that the shareholders do not participate in the control of the Company.
                              However, should the shareholder own more than 10% of the capital or
                              voting rights, the Board, based on a report by the Appointments Committee,
                              must systematically investigate the Director's independence, taking
                              into account the Company's ownership structure and the existence of
                              a potential conflict of interest (cf §8.7 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code);<br/>
</a>
<a class="pos_a_name" name="">
<sup>(b)</sup>
                              The Board of Directors may take the view
                              that a Director who fulfils the aforementioned criteria should not
                              be deemed independent because of his or her particular situation or
                              that of the Company, given the Company's ownership structure or for
                              any other reason. Conversely the Board may consider that a Director
                              although not satisfying the above criteria is however independent
                              (cf §8.4 last paragraph of the AFEP-MEDEF Code).<br/>
</a>
</p>
<p>The position of the two Independent Directors (Mrs Gri and Mrs
                              Pourre) was examined with respect to the first criterion.
                              </p>
<p>Mrs Gri and Mrs Pourre are Directors of Crédit Agricole S.A.. The
                              Appointments Committee and the Board of Directors considered that
                              this resulted from Crédit Agricole S.A.'s desire for the Chairwomen
                              of its Audit Committee and Risk Committee to play a special role vis-a-vis
                              its subsidiaries to ensure continuity in their mission and that this
                              was unlikely to jeopardise their independence.
                              </p>
<p>The situation of five Independent female Directors was examined
                              with regards to the third criterion.
                              </p>
<p>The Appointments Committee and the Board of Directors established
                              that the companies in which the five Directors hold functions or mandates
                              did not have any commercial dealings with the Company or that the
                              commercial NBI realised by Crédit Agricole S.A. with these entities
                              was insignificant and was unlikely to jeopardise their independence.
                              This examination was performed for the Kering Group, Albioma and Saft
                              Group (Mrs Daveu), for the Michelin Group (Mrs Dorland Clauzel), for
                              Eurogroup Consulting (Mrs Noat), for Edenred, WNS Services and 21
                              Centrale Partner (Mrs Gri) and for SEB, Neopost and Bénéteau (Mrs
                              Pourre).
                              </p>
<p>The Appointments Committee and the Board of Directors also noted
                              that their respective positions in these companies did not mean that
                              they were involved in, or had direct business dealings with, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ A BALANCED
                              REPRESENTATION OF MEN AND WOMEN AND DIVERSITY ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
                              </h4>
<p>At 31 December 2017, the Board of Directors had eight female members,
                              seven of whom were appointed by the General Meeting, i.e. 50% of the
                              Directors appointed by the Shareholders' General Meeting.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with Article 435[2 c] of EU Regulation No. 575/2013
                              and Article L. 511-99 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the
                              Appointments Committee reviewed the objective of a balance between
                              the genders on the Board of Directors, and the policy required to
                              achieve it.
                              </p>
<p>Pursuant to Article L. 225-17 of the French Commercial Code, there
                              must be a balanced representation of women and men on the Board of
                              Directors. In accordance with Article L. 225-18-1 of the French Commercial
                              Code, this balanced representation, in Crédit Agricole CIB's case,
                              must result in a proportion which cannot be less than 40% for each
                              sex.
                              </p>
<p>The Appointments Committee also noted that the proportion of women
                              among the Directors appointed by the Crédit Agricole Corporate and
                              Investment Bank General Meeting of Shareholders was 50%. The Bank
                              has an objective of maintaining this ratio at 40% minimum for each
                              sex. The policy developed involves actively seeking suitable high
                              quality candidates - both men and women - in order to ensure that
                              this ratio is respected if the members of the Board of Directors changes,
                              whilst ensuring complementarity between the Directors' careers, experiences
                              and skills.
                              </p>
<p>Mrs Audrey Contaut and Mr Jean de Dieu Batina were elected as Directors
                              to represent the employees in accordance with Articles L. 225-27 et
                              seq. of the French Commercial Code and Article 9 of the Company's
                              Articles of Association.
                              </p>
<p>The composition of the Board of Directors reflects not only the
                              shareholding (Crédit Agricole CIB is more than 99% owned by Crédit
                              Agricole Group companies), but also the desire to bring on-board Directors
                              from diverse backgrounds in terms of education, skills and professional
                              experience (a short biography of each Director is provided in section
                              1.3.1 of this report).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.2.6 Training
                              for Directors
                              </h4>
<p>A procedure defined in 2013 to welcome new Directors includes the
                              delivery to any new Director of a welcome booklet, which presents
                              key documents relating to the governance of the Company's corporate
                              bodies, the Company's strategy and budget, the Registration Document
                              and the activity report for the previous year. When a new Director
                              first joins the Board, meetings are also organised between the new
                              Director and Executive Management members, the Head of Risks and Permanent
                              Control, the CFO and the Head of Compliance and the Head of Human
                              Resources.
                              </p>
<p>In addition to the programme established for new Directors, training
                              measures for all Directors continued in 2017. A seminar for Directors
                              held in June 2017 provided an opportunity for a better understanding
                              of the expectations of the Bank's customers by meeting the top management
                              of two of Crédit Agricole CIB's biggest customers to improve the knowledge
                              of the Bank's activities and strategy. A training session devoted
                              to the challenges of compliance and the impact of MIFID2 on the Company's
                              organisation and activity was held in October 2017. Directors also
                              benefit from permanent access to an e-learning programme offering
                              various courses on the theme of compliance.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 22530-2
                              and R. 225-34-3 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors,
                              at its meeting on 12 December 2017, determined the training to be
                              followed by the employee Directors in 2018.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, if judged opportune, a Director can receive individual
                              training especially on taking up new functions on the Board or its
                              committees. This type of training was organised for a Director in
                              2017.

                              committees of the Board of Directors
                              </h4>
<p>The Board has four specialised committees: an Audit Committee,
                              a Risk Committee, an Appointments Committee, and a Compensation Committee.
                              </p>
<p>The members of these committees are appointed by the Board of Directors
                              in accordance with its rules of procedures. These specialised committees
                              assist the Board of Directors in its duties and in preparing for discussions.
                              They may, for example, conduct studies or submit opinions or recommendations
                              to the Board.
                              </p>
<p>The committees interact where appropriate to ensure consistency
                              in their work. Each committee reports on its work to the Board of
                              Directors so that members can be fully informed when participating
                              in discussions.
                              </p>
<p>Each committee carries out the missions that are assigned by the
                              law and the regulations in force, as well as by the rules of procedures
                              of the Board of Directors and meets periodically and as necessary,
                              in order to review any subject within its jurisdiction. The committee
                              can request access to all the information it deems relevant to perform
                              its mission.
                              </p>
<p>Each committee bases its work mainly on the summary information
                              provided by the departments and on the interviews or meetings that
                              it holds with Company people deemed useful for the performance of
                              its missions; if it so wishes, these interviews or meetings can be
                              held without the presence of the Executive Management. After informing
                              the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and in order to report to
                              the Board of Directors, the committee can have any studies required
                              to assist the Board's deliberations drawn up at the Company's costs,
                              after verifying the objectivity of the expert selected.

                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has established a responsible compensation
                              policy that aims to reflect its values while respecting the interests
                              of all the stakeholders, be they employees, clients or shareholders.
                              </p>
<p>In light of the specific characteristics of its business lines,
                              its legal entities, and national and international legislation, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB strives to develop a compensation system that provides
                              its employees with a competitive reward relative to its market benchmark
                              in order to attract and retain the talent it needs. Benchmarking exercises
                              against other financial groups are regularly carried out for this
                              purpose.
                              </p>
<p>Compensation awards, particularly variable ones, aim to reward
                              individual and group performance over time while promoting sound and
                              effective risk management.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB compensation policy contributes to compliance
                              with the risk appetite statement and framework approved by its governing
                              bodies.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB compensation policy is also part of a highly
                              regulated environment that is specific to the banking sector. In general,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB ensures the compliance of its compensation policy

<p>Fixed compensation rewards employees for the responsibilities entrusted

                              that is consistent with the specificities of each business line in
                              their local market.
                              </p>
<p>These responsibilities are defined by a remit and contributions,
                              an echelon within the organization and a profile of expected skills
                              and experience.
                              </p>
<p>Fixed compensation is determined in proportions such that it is
                              possible to not award variable compensation in the event of insufficient
                              performance.
                              </p>
<p>Employees' fixed compensation is increased according to changes
                              in their responsibilities and their proficiency in their role, which
                              is assessed through the annual performance appraisal on the basis
                              of the fulfilment of objectives and contributions to the role.
                              </p>
<p>When an employee is given a new role, the change in responsibilities
                              is taken into account when determining the fixed compensation.
                              </p>
<p>Fixed compensation is made up of the base salary, as well as of
                              any other stable, recurring compensation component that is not performance-based
                              in any way.

<p>Variable compensation is directly linked to individual and collective
                              annual performance. Individual performance is assessed based on the
                              achievement of qualitative and quantitative objectives, as well as
                              proper compliance with internal rules and procedures.
                              </p>
<p>Collective performance is based on the determination of a firm-wide
                              envelope which is then broken down by business activity. This envelope
                              is defined in a way which does not limit the capacity of Crédit Agricole
                              CIB to strengthen its equity capital as required. It takes all risks
                              into account, including liquidity risk, as well as the cost of capital,
                              in compliance with regulatory principles.
                              </p>
<p>Variable compensation is made up of the bonus, as well as of any
                              other individual compensation component linked to performance, including

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's total envelope for variable compensation

                              </p>
<p>The Contribution is determined using the following formula, on
                              the basis of the standard accounting definitions:
                              </p>
<p>Net Banking Income (NBI) - direct and indirect expenses excluding
                              bonuses - cost of risk - cost of capital before taxes
                              </p>
<p>Revenues are calculated net of liquidity costs.</p>
<p>The cost of risk is understood to be the provisions for default</p>
<p>Cost of capital, used to take into account the return on equity
                              specific to an activity, is calculated by applying the following formula:
                              </p>
<p>Average risk weighted assets (RWA) x Capital supply rate (target
                              Tier 1 ratio) x ß (coefficient measuring the market risk of an activity
                              and enabling an adjustment to the Tier 1 ratio according to the capital
                              requirements of the business line).
                              </p>

<p>Mr Jean-Yves Hocher has been the Chief Executive Officer of Crédit
                              Agricole CIB since 1 December 2010.
                              </p>
<p>He oversees the Global Compliance (CPL), Corporate Secretary &amp;
                              Communication (CSE) and General Inspection (IGE) Departments.
                              </p>
<p>With effect from 1 September 2015, Mr Jean-Yves Hocher's term of
                              office as Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A. came
                              to an end, leading to the reinstatement of his employment contract,
                              which had been suspended throughout his term of office.
                              </p>
<p>Concomitantly with this reinstatement, it was decided, with the
                              agreement of the latter, that his compensation would be fully borne
                              by Crédit Agricole S.A. from this date onwards. This change was approved
                              by the Crédit Agricole CIB Board of Directors on 29 October 2015.
                              Thus, since 1 September 2015, Mr Jean-Yves Hocher has exercised his
                              office of Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole CIB free of charge.
                              </p>
<p>His compensation is therefore determined by Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              for his employment contract with that company and is reported for
                              information purposes to the Board of Directors of Crédit Agricole
                              CIB.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB continues to cover only the portion of the
                              variable compensation awarded for periods prior to 1 September 2015.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">FIXED COMPENSATION</h4>
<p>Under his Crédit Agricole S.A. employment contract Mr JeanYves
                              Hocher benefits from an annual fixed compensation of €550,000.

                              </h4>
<p>No supplementary pension amount is payable to Mr Régis Monfront
                              in respect of the 2017 financial year.
                              </p>
<p>Mr Régis Monfront is a beneficiary of the supplementary pension
                              scheme for Crédit Agricole CIB Executive Managers (closed scheme),
                              which supplements the collective and mandatory retirement pension
                              and death and disability schemes that were subject to the regulated
                              agreements procedure, the details of which are set forth in the Statutory
                              Auditors' special report for the 2016 financial year.
                              </p>
<p>As regards the defined-benefit pension plan, Mr Régis Monfront
                              has at least 15 years' service and had already reached the maximum
                              applicable replacement ratio before the renewal of his corporate office
                              as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, his renewed term
                              of office does not entail any new conditional rights (supplementary
                              replacement ratio) as defined in paragraphs 2, 7 and 8 of Article
                              L. 225-42-1 as amended by Law No 2015990 of 6 August 2015.
                              </p>
<p>There is therefore no requirement to make the payment of his supplementary
                              pension scheme conditional on his performance and paragraphs 2, 7
                              and 8 of Article L. 225-42-1, as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August
                              2015, do not apply given that no new conditional rights apply to his
                              renewed term of office.
                              </p>
<p>The uncertain entitlements under the defined-benefit supplementary
                              pension scheme are subject to continued employment conditions at retirement
                              and are estimated on the basis of 36 years of service recorded on
                              the closing date.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2017, there was no increase in the estimated conditional
                              entitlements (expressed as a percentage of the benchmark compensation)
                              as compared to 31 December 2016. On this basis, the provisions of
                              Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, modified by Law
                              No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015 on economic growth, activity and equal
                              economic opportunities, which limits any increase in these conditional
                              rights to 3% per annum, were thus respected.
                              </p>
<p>Mr Régis Monfront's annual individual pension entitlements as at
                              31 December 2017 break down as:

<p>The target achievement rate, 50% of which corresponds to quantifiable

<p>Mr Jacques Prost is a beneficiary of the supplementary pension

                              collective and mandatory retirement pension and death and disability
                              schemes that were subject to the regulated agreements procedure, the

                              </p>
<p>As this comes under the defined-benefit plan, the annual vesting
                              of entitlements is conditional on Crédit Agricole CIB's performance
                              conditions, in accordance with Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial
                              Code as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015. The annual vesting
                              of Mr Prost's entitlements is therefore subject, in accordance with
                              the Board of Directors decision of 2 November 2016, to a performance

                              at 31 December 2017, giving an increase in the conditional entitlements
                              of +1.2 % compared to the 2016 financial year.

<p>No supplementary pension amount is payable to Mr François Marion
                              in respect of the 2017 financial year.
                              </p>
<p>Mr François Marion is a beneficiary of the supplementary pension
                              scheme for Crédit Agricole CIB Executive Managers (closed scheme),
                              which supplements the collective and mandatory retirement pension
                              and death and disability schemes that were subject to the regulated
                              agreements procedure, the details of which are set forth in the Statutory
                              Auditors' special report for the 2016 financial year.
                              </p>
<p>As regards the defined-benefit pension plan, Mr François Marion
                              has at least 1 5 years' service and had already reached the maximum
                              applicable replacement ratio before the renewal of his corporate office
                              as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, his renewed term
                              of office does not entail any new conditional rights (supplementary
                              replacement ratio) as defined in paragraphs 2, 7 and 8 of Article
                              L. 225-42-1 as amended by Law No 2015990 of 6 August 2015. There is
                              therefore no requirement to make the payment of his supplementary
                              pension scheme conditional on his performance and paragraphs 2, 7
                              and 8 of Article L. 22542-1, as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August
                              2015, do not apply given that no new conditional rights apply to his
                              renewed term of office.
                              </p>
<p>The uncertain entitlements under the defined-benefit supplementary
                              pension scheme are subject to continued employment conditions at retirement
                              and are estimated on the basis of 34 years of service recorded on
                              the closing date. At 31 December 2017, there was no increase in the
                              estimated conditional entitlements (expressed as a percentage of the
                              benchmark compensation) as compared to 31 December 2016.
                              </p>
<p>On this basis, the provisions of Article L. 225-42-1 of the French
                              Commercial Code, modified by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015 on economic
                              growth, activity and equal economic opportunities, which limits any
                              increase in these conditional rights to 3% per annum, were thus respected.
                              </p>
<p>Mr François Marion's annual individual pension entitlements as
                              at 31 December 2017 break down as:

<p>I. Transfers of shares for the benefit of spouses, ascendants and
                              descendants are free.
                              </p>
<p>The same applies to transfers to a person appointed Director, within
                              the limit of the number of shares required for the exercise of his
                              function, as well as transfers in favour of Crédit Agricole S.A. and
                              any company under its control, within the meaning of Article L. 233-3
                              I &amp; II of the French Commercial Code.
                              </p>
<p>II. Except in the cases referred to in I. above, no natural or
                              legal person ("the transferee") may become a shareholder of the Company
                              or the holder of a dismembered right in respect of any share or right
                              arising therefrom, in any manner ("the transfer"), if it has not been
                              previously approved by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, under
                              the conditions set out below:
                              </p>
<p>1° The request for approval of the transferee is notified to the
                              Company by an extrajudicial act or by registered letter with acknowledgement
                              of receipt, indicating the transferee's surname, first names and address,
                              the number of shares that are planned to be assigned, as well as the
                              price offered and the conditions of the sale. Approval is granted
                              either by way of a notification, or through the failure to reply within
                              three months of the request.
                              </p>
<p>The approval decision is made by the Chairman. No justification
                              will be given for the decision, and refusals may never give rise to
                              a legal claim.
                              </p>
<p>The transferor is informed of the decision, within fifteen days
                              of receipt of the notification, by registered letter with acknowledgement
                              of receipt.
                              </p>
<p>In case of refusal, the transferor will have ten days from receipt
                              to make known, using the same means, whether he waives his proposed
                              transfer or not.
                              </p>
<p>2° In the event that the transferor does not waive his proposed
                              transfer, the Chairman is obliged, within three months from the notification
                              of the refusal, to have the shares acquired, either by shareholders
                              or by third parties or, with the consent of the transferor, by the
                              Company for the purpose of reducing the capital.
                              </p>
<p>For this purpose, the Chairman will notify the shareholders of
                              the proposed sale, by registered letter, inviting each to indicate
                              the number of shares he or she wants to acquire.
                              </p>
<p>The purchase offers are sent by the shareholders to the Chairman,
                              by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, within ten days
                              of the notification they have received. The distribution between the
                              shareholders purchasing the offered shares is made by the Chairman,
                              in proportion to their participation in the capital and within the
                              limit of their requests.
                              </p>
<p>3° If no request for purchase is sent to the Chairman within the
                              above time limit, or if the requests do not concern all of the shares,
                              the Chairman may have the available shares purchased by third parties.
                              </p>
<p>4° With the transferor's approval, the shares may also be purchased
                              by the Company. The Chairman requests this approval by registered
                              letter with acknowledgement of receipt to which the transferor must
                              respond within ten days following its receipt.
                              </p>
<p>If the transferor approves, on the proposal of the Chairman, the
                              Board of Directors convenes an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders
                              to decide on the repurchase of the shares by the Company and the corresponding
                              reduction of the share capital. This notice must be given early enough
                              to respect the three-month period below.
                              </p>
<p>In all cases of purchase or repurchase mentioned above, the price
                              of the shares is set as indicated in paragraph 6 below.
                              </p>
<p>5° If all of the shares are not purchased or repurchased within
                              three months from the notification of the refusal of approval, the
                              transferor may realize the sale for the benefit of the original transferee,
                              for all the shares sold, notwithstanding any partial purchase offers
                              that may have been made.
                              </p>
<p>This time limit of three months may be extended by order of the
                              President of the Commercial Court, without appeal, at the request
                              of the Company, the transferor shareholder and the transferee, duly
                              summoned.
                              </p>
<p>6° In the event that the shares offered are purchased by shareholders
                              or third parties, the Chairman shall notify the transferor of the
                              surname, first names and domicile of the purchaser(s). Failing agreement
                              between the parties, the price of the shares shall be determined under
                              the conditions provided for in Article 1843-4 of the French Civil
                              Code.
                              </p>
<p>The expertise fees shall be shared equally between the buyer and
                              the seller.
                              </p>
<p>7° Within eight days of the determination of the price, a notice
                              is sent to the transferor, by registered letter with acknowledgement
                              of receipt, requesting that he make known, within fifteen days of
                              receipt of said notice, whether he waives the transfer or, if not,
                              informs him to proceed to the registered office to pay this price,
                              which is not interest-bearing, and sign the movement order. If the
                              transferor does not appear within the fifteen-day period referred
                              to above, or does not notify the Company within this period of his
                              renunciation, the transfer on behalf of the purchaser(s) takes place
                              automatically following the order from the Chairman of the Board of
                              Directors or a specially mandated person, with effect from the date
                              of this transfer.
                              </p>
<p>8° The provisions of this article generally apply to any means
                              of ownership transfer, whether free of charge, for value, over-the-counter
                              or otherwise, even if the transfer takes place via public tender by
                              virtue of a judicial, private, voluntary or forced decision. They
                              are applicable in the event of incorporation, partial asset transfer,
                              merger or demerger or transfer of all assets.
                              </p>
<p>9° The approval clause, which is the subject of this article, also
                              applies to the transfer of the allocation rights in the event of a
                              capital increase by incorporation of reserves, profits or share premiums.
                              It also applies in the event of transfer of the subscription right
                              to a capital increase in cash or an individual waiver of the subscription
                              right in favour of persons named. In either case, the right of approval
                              and the repurchase conditions stipulated in this article apply to
                              the subscribed shares, and the time limit given to the Chairman to
                              notify the third party subscriber whether or not he accepts it as
                              shareholder is three months from the date of final completion of the
                              capital increase.
                              </p>
<p>In case of repurchase, the price of the shares shall be determined
                              under the conditions provided for in Article 1843-4 of the French
                              Civil Code.
                              </p>
<p>10° In case of allocation of Company shares, following the division
                              of a company owning these shares, allocations to persons who are not
                              already shareholders shall be subject to the approval set down in
                              this article.
                              </p>
<p>Consequently, any planned attribution to persons other than shareholders
                              must be the object of a request for approval by the liquidator of
                              the company under the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above.
                              </p>
<p>In the absence of notification to the liquidator of the Chairman's
                              decision, within three months of the request for approval, this approval
                              shall be considered acquired.
                              </p>
<p>In case of refusal to approve certain beneficiaries, the liquidator
                              may, within thirty days of the notification of the refusal of approval,
                              modify the attributions in such a way as to present only approved
                              beneficiaries.
                              </p>
<p>In the event that no beneficiary is approved, as in the case where
                              the liquidator has not modified his sharing project within the above
                              time limit, the shares allocated to the non-approved shareholders
                              must be bought or repurchased from the company in liquidation, under
                              the conditions set out under paragraphs 2 to 4 above. In the absence
                              of purchase or repurchase of all shares, the object of the refusal
                              of approval, within the time limit set down in paragraph 5 above,
                              the sharing can be realized according to the presented project.
                              </p>
<p>III. Transfers of shares by succession or in case of liquidation
                              of community of property between spouses are free.
                              </p>

                              AND OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SHARES
                              </h4>
<p>Each share entitles the holder thereof to a proportionate ownership
                              right in the assets of the Company and in the proceeds after liquidation
                              equal to the pro rata portion of the registered capital represented
                              by such share, taking into account, if applicable, the amortised and
                              unamortised capital, or the paid up and unpaid capital, of the nominal
                              amount of the shares and the rights of the shares of different categories.
                              </p>
<p>All shares which represent or will represent part of the share
                              capital will be included as share capital for tax purposes. Thus,
                              all duties and taxes which, for whatever reason, may become payable
                              by certain holders upon distribution of capital, either during the
                              existence of the Company or at liquidation, will be allocated among
                              all shares representing capital at the time of such distribution or
                              distributions, with the result that, after taking into account the
                              unredeemed nominal value of the shares to the extent of their respective
                              rights, all present or future shares will confer upon the holders
                              thereof the same effective benefits and the right to receive the same
                              net amounts.
                              </p>
<p>Whenever it is necessary to possess a certain number of shares

                              together and, if necessary, to purchase or sell the requisite number

<p>Most financial information published by Crédit Agricole CIB is

                              </p>
<p>All management data is checked to ensure that it has been properly
                              reconciled with the accounting data and that it complies with the

                              data. Group Financial Control checks that the sum of business-line

                              to the Crédit Agricole CIB Group's consolidated results. This check
                              is made easier by the fact that the analytical unit (profit centre)
                              is integrated within the entities' accounting information system.

<p>Management data are prepared using calculation methods that ensure

                              AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
                              </h4>
<p>The stages of the cyclical recovery were slow to materialise, casting
                              doubt on the ability of economies to extricate themselves from the
                              sluggish growth environment. Output had regained some strength, but
                              job creation was mediocre and wages weren't picking up. lnvestment
                              remained muted and prices were too moderate. Then the cyclical recovery
                              finally arrived, and a virtuous circle emerged between production,
                              investment, jobs, revenues and demand -albeit slowly. ln 2017, the
                              recovery finally gained strength thanks to an acceleration in productive
                              investment, which had been late taking off. The growth surprised on
                              the upside: only inflation has yet to make a significant recovery
                              and remains subdued.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, real growth in the United States - bolstered by consumer
                              spending and, of late, productive investment - reached +2.3%. Strong
                              job numbers continued to fuel confidence and household spending. At
                              4.1%, the unemployment rate fell below what the Federal Reserve calls
                              its "natural rate" (4.6%). However, inflation (2.1%) lagged behind
                              expectations, only slowly edging toward the Fed's 2% target. In the
                              Eurozone, all of the conditions needed to trigger a growth phase under
                              the classic macroeconomic model finally came together. The recovery
                              gained momentum gradually, today's growth rate is likely close to
                              its maximum (2.4% in 2017). While it was aided by a highly favourable
                              external environment (a strong global manufacturing cycle, in particular),
                              growth became increasingly independent, driven by its robust domestic
                              demand. Despite the sustained growth, inflation (+1.4% in December
                              2017) did not accelerate significantly. Underlying inflation remains
                              weak at +1%. Finally, in France, despite numerous uncertainties (particularly
                              around the presidential elections), +1.9% growth was achieved. This
                              represents a substantial acceleration after three consecutive years
                              of lacklustre growth (around + 1% annuaily).
                              </p>
<p>The financial markets, which had earlier benefited from the socalled
                              reflation trade (interest rate hikes and an equity market rally driven
                              by the view that growth and inflation would rise in the United States,
                              an outlook influenced by Donald Trump's bullish stance on the economy),
                              were disappointed at the beginning of the year. The US President's
                              crowning achievement would be delayed until the end of the year, when
                              the wide-reaching (and costly) tax reform was finally passed. The
                              markets then shifted their concerns to the elections in Europe, and
                              particularly France.
                              </p>
<p>They were occasionally spooked by less accommodative monetary policy
                              moves. Despite the brief spells of trouble, the markets nonetheless
                              had a relatively good year. There was no abrupt shift in long yields,
                              with German and US 10-year yields situated at 0.43% and 2.48%, respectively,
                              at the end of December (up 20 and 5 basis points, respectively). Thus,
                              the bond markets were successfully able to "digest" the monetary tightening
                              in the United States. The Federal Reserve adjusted its key rate on
                              three occasions, raising it by 25 basis points each time. ln December
                              2017, the federal funds rate stood at 1.50%. The Fed also undertook
                              "quantitative tightening", or the gradual reduction of its balance
                              sheet. Meanwhile, in October the European Central Bank (ECB) extended
                              its quantitative easing programme but reduced its monthly purchases
                              of sovereign bonds from €60 billion to €30 billion for the period
                              from January 2018 to September 2018. Finally, the Eurozone's strong
                              recent growth and the retreat of political risk have enabled the euro
                              to gradually return to admirable performance level. Spurred on by
                              the belief that Asian central banks might reduce their appetite for
                              US-denominated assets and diversify their reserves with more euro
                              holdings, the euro (at 1.20) rose +14% against the US dollar in 2017.

</p>
<p>This year the financial markets were affected by several political
                              and monetary events.
                              </p>
<p>The inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January and his
                              speech on the economy contributed to the rise in interest rates and
                              in the equity markets at the start of the year.
                              </p>
<p>In France, a period of deep pre-election uncertainty marked the
                              start of the second quarter with the markets taking into account a
                              "Frexit" scenario leading to an increase in volatility. Post-election
                              results dissipated the specific risks to France and the systematic
                              risk to Europe.
                              </p>
<p>Lastly, the Fed continued the normalisation of its monetary policy
                              by raising its key rate three times, while the ECB extended its policy
                              of quantitative easing throughout the year. In October, it announced
                              a reduction from €60 to €30 billion in the monthly amount of its bond
                              purchases from January 2018.
                              </p>
<p>In this context, the investment banking activities demonstrated
                              their resistance, posting income up 4% over one year, reaching €4,587
                              million at the end of December 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The income from capital markets and investment banking increased
                              by 4% impacted by highly favourable effects on the valuation components
                              of the x-value adjustments (xVA). In a less volatile context than
                              in 2016, the Fixed Income &amp; Treasury businesses were down affected
                              by a slowdown in commercial activity, with the exception of the product
                              lines Securitisation and Credit. Investment banking income was supported
                              by the good performance of the M&amp;A business.
                              </p>
<p>Income from financing activities was up 3% over 2016, driven mainly
                              by income from commercial banking, which in turn benefited from the
                              growth of the Private Equity financing activities and the rise in
                              oil prices. Despite the difficulties in the Shipping and Energy sectors,
                              under an origination constraint, the structured financing business
                              line performed well, carried by Aero-Rail, Telecom and Acquisition
                              Finance, and benefited from exceptional income.
                              </p>
<p>The operating expenses increased by 1%, related to the increase
                              in the number of internal employees, an increase in project costs
                              and taxes. These increases were attenuated by exceptional elements
                              in 2016 and 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The gross operating income from underlying investment banking was
                              up 7% year-on-year.
                              </p>
<p>The cost of risk continued its downward trend in comparison with
                              2016, which was strongly impacted by a reinforcement of provisions,
                              especially in the Oil &amp; Gas and Shipping sectors.
                              </p>
<p>The net income from the underlying equity-accounted entities amounted
                              to €175 million in 2017. On 11 September 2017, CACIB signed a disposal
                              agreement for 16.2% of Banque Saudi Fransi, out of the 31.1% held.
                              The transaction was carried out on 20 September 2017. The net income
                              from this disposal amounted to €102 million, isolated in the column
                              "Non-recurring".
                              </p>
<p>The underlying tax charge amounted to -€611 million, up by 79%.
                              This increase is related to exceptional issues in 2017 while in 2016
                              favourable adjustments were made.
                              </p>
<p>The net income group share of the Wealth Management business line
                              was down by 4% compared to 2016, and suffered from the booking of
                              exceptional charges related to the acquisition of the wealth management
                              activities of Crédit Industriel et Commercial in Singapore and Hong
                              Kong.
                              </p>
<p>The results for the Corporate Centre include the revaluation of
                              the issuer spread amounting to -€220 million, a result of the tightening
                              of spreads in 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The CACIB Group share of net income amounted to €1,156 million,
                              down by -2% compared to 2016.

<p>Income from commercial banking rose by 6% (8% at constant exchange

                              and Global Trade thanks to the development of financing funds (synergies
                              between CACIB/CACEIS/Indosuez Wealth Management). The rise in prices

<p>Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or
                              loss (excluding repurchase agreements) were down by €45.4 billion
                              and €45.2 billion respectively over the period. On the asset side,
                              they consist mainly in the positive fair value of interest rate derivatives
                              and of the portfolio of securities held for trading, while on the
                              liabilities side they reflect the negative value of derivatives and
                              securities sold short. The reduction in outstanding amounts results
                              mainly from the netting on interest rate derivatives and non-profit-making

<p>The repo activities are largely concentrated in Paris, which accounted

                              agreements in 2017 comes mainly from the increase in trading activities

                              </h4>
<p>The strength and scope of the current cycle is a positive surprise.
                              So far we haven't seen any of the imbalances that traditionally accompany
                              very strong growth, most notably inflation and external imbalances.
                              Such imbalances usually foreshadow a downturn. Ln terms of price formation,
                              while there was previously a stronger link between lower unemployment
                              and higher wages, today's trends are being influenced by structural
                              factors such as international competition, the outsourcing of highly
                              labour-intensive production, the expansion of the service sector and
                              the ''uberisation" of work in the advanced economies. This has contributed
                              to weak inflation numbers. Some aspects of the current cycle can also
                              be traced back to the financial crisis of 2008. The crisis left deep
                              scars that are only slowly healing. Thus the true imbalances may not
                              yet be visible, particularly in the form of inflation. While the pace
                              of growth may be approaching or even exceeding the potential growth
                              rate (+1.8% in the US, +1.5% in the Eurozone), this does mean that
                              the output gap has closed. The gap is narrowing, but very slowly:
                              it has been zero in Germany since 2014, but the process has taken
                              longer in the United States (2017) and the Eurozone (2018). Thus,
                              with the notable exceptions of the United States and Germany, the
                              majority of economies are still not running at full capacity.
                              </p>
<p>Considering all these factors, we believe the current cycle will
                              deliver a few more positive quarters before naturally dying down with
                              a whimper, not a bang. We anticipate a very modest acceleration of
                              growth in the United States. Alter reaching +2.3% in 2017, US growth
                              should be +2.4% in 2018, a level it should be able to achieve without
                              tax stimulus. Indeed, some forecasts suggest that the additional growth
                              boost from the Republicans' tax measures will be modest. lndependent,
                              self- sustaining growth is continuing in the United States, and also
                              in the Eurozone, where growth is expected to slow very slightly (to
                              +2.3%) in 2018. ln France, leading economic indicators point to a
                              virtuous circle, with recoveries in corporate investment, real estate
                              and job creation. France's growth rate should hold relatively steady
                              in 2018 (+1.9%) and 2019 (+1.6%), with no acceleration predicted from
                              2017 levels. This growth will essentially come down to household spending
                              and corporate investment, while foreign trade should continue to weigh
                              down on growth. Finally, the emerging economies have seen their growth
                              accelerate thanks to global demand. Household spending is taking over
                              as their leading driver of growth. As a result, the emerging economies
                              as a whole should be able to repeat their 2017 growth of +4.7% in
                              2018. This scenario of resilient, comfortable (that is, not excessive)
                              growth depends on an assumption about the Chinese economy: namely,
                              that it is headed for a controlled slowdown.
                              </p>
<p>So far, inflationary pressures seem to be at bay. At the end of
                              2018, inflation amounted to +2.2% in the United States and +1.4% in
                              the Eurozone. ln France, inflation should also remain moderate and
                              quite stable at around +1% for the 2018-2019 period (vs, +1% in 2017),
                              despite a slow rise in core inflation. Thus, the central banks, including
                              the ECB, are not lagging behind the real economic cycle. Therefore,
                              there is no need for urgent monetary policy moves. The current and
                              upcoming monetary policy tightening measures will proceed at a gradual
                              pace. The Fed will continue slowly ''normalising" interest rates and
                              its balance sheet. The members of the Federal Open Market Committee
                              anticipate three hikes to the federal funds rate in 2018, ending the
                              year at 2.25%. Meanwhile, the ECB will proceed with its asset purchase
                              programme, spending €30 billion monthly until September 2018, after
                              which the programme should be further extended with a lower purchase
                              amount. The ECB will commit to ending quantitative easing in December
                              2018 at the earliest while sbabilising its balance sheet. It will
                              begin reducing its balance sheet at a much later date. A rise in key
                              interest rates is not expected before the end of 2019.
                              </p>
<p>Monetary policies thus remain accommodative despite the current
                              and planned tightening moves, and they will continue to support growth.
                              Meanwhile, the resolution of government imbalances will be facilitated
                              by low bond yields, in the major dollar and euro currency zones. US
                              and German 10- year yields have tightened by almost +35 and +30 basis
                              points respectively since the beginning of the year and now sit at
                              2.80% and 0.70%- levels that are still low but on a surprising uptrend.
                              Although it may seem aggressive, we should compare it to recent tightening
                              episodes. US yields rose by +80 basis points in the wake of Donald
                              Trump's election and close to +135 basis point during the taper tantrum
                              in 2013. Meanwhile, German yields jumped by +90 basis points in April
                              2015, a trend that was warranted by the unwinding of long positions
                              and not by economic factors. What is behind this recent tightening?
                              Solid economic results that are exceeding expectations. Although they
                              are not triggering a notable pick-up in inflation, they are corroborating
                              the central bankers' scenario of a slow rise towards inflation targets
                              and pushing the markets to sign off (at least so it would seem) on
                              the impending monetary policy tightening. Moreover although the decline
                              in the equity markets invites caution, rising interest rates do not
                              seem synonymous with an irrepressible risk-off trend, as evidenced
                              by the tightening of yield premiums on non-core Eurozone countries.
                              We are therefore anticipating an orderly rise in long yields, despite
                              inevitable periods of turbulence, while real rates should remain low
                              or even negative. US and German 10-year yields should end 2018 at
                              2.90% and 0.90%, respectively. Meanwhile, the risk premiums offered
                              by France and Italy (taking into account a high probability of election-related
                              tension) should amount to +35 and +175 basis points, respectively.
                              </p>
<p>While our scenario is reasonably calm, there are still numerous
                              latent risks that could suddenly manifest themselves. Of the many
                              alarming economic and political risks that could emerge, the timeframe
                              of our scenario forces us to focus on those that have the potential
                              to materialise with tangible impacts in a relatively short term. With
                              a hard landing by China's economy excluded from our scenario, there
                              are still dangers that threaten to derail our success story. A misstep
                              in monetary policy could lead to a sharp rise in long yields, or there
                              could be a downturn on the US equity market. Given that forward guidance
                              by the major central banks seems to have anchored inflation anticipations
                              (we do not expect inflation to pick up significantly), the first potential
                              pitfall should be avoided.

<p>The increase in assets from customer transactions was the result
                              of higher income from repurchase agreements amounting to €6.1 billion,

                              </p>
<p>Under assets, this decrease may be explained by the decrease in

<p>Under liabilities, the decrease comes from optional instruments

                              At the same time, counterparty transactions on trading securities
                              increased by €2.3 billion and payables on securities borrowed by €2

<p>Net banking income for the 2017 financial year reached €4.6 billion,
                              €1.2 billion higher than at 31 December 2016. An error was corrected
                              during the 2017 financial year. It relates to a regularisation of
                              the staggering of up-front fees, received and paid, relating to the
                              purchase and sale of CDS recognised as hedging, over the course of
                              several prior financial years. The impact of this correction on the
                              net banking income FY2017 is to €416 million.
                              </p>
<p>Operating expenses, excluding provisions, increased by €60.5 million
                              (+2.59%).
                              </p>
<p>In view of these factors, gross operating income increased by €1.3
                              billion (x2.4) to €2.2 billion at 31 December 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The cost of risk was -€300 million in 2017 compared to -€536 million
                              in 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The aggregation "Net gain/(loss) on fixed assets" consists mainly
                              of gains on disposals of Bank Saudi Fransi securities for €1,215 million.

                              </p>
<p>The aggregation "Income tax charge" consists mainly of a provision
                              for tax on the capital gain on the disposals of Banque Saudi Fransi
                              Securities and a tax adjustement for the error correction on the income
                              of previous years.

                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has learned from the 2007/2008 crisis and has
                              considerably reduced its risk appetite, primarily by suspending or
                              cutting back on some of its market activities. Its strategic guidelines
                              and management and control systems have therefore been scaled in such
                              a way as to maintain a controlled risk profile which is adapted to
                              well-thought-out commercial ambitions, a still uncertain economic
                              climate and greater regulation.
                              </p>
<p>The Board of Directors approved Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite
                              for the first time on 30 July 2015. It is updated regularly and at
                              least annually by the Board so that it will remain consistent with
                              the financial objectives of Crédit Agricole CIB and reflect the regulatory
                              constraints, in particular Pillar II. The 2017 risk appetite was approved
                              by the Board on 10 February 2017.

                              ensure that it is still compliant with the risk appetite which has
                              been defined and, where necessary, the risk appetite should be adjusted

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">• RISK APPETITE,
                              SPECIFIC RISK STRATEGIES AND SECTOR POLICIES
                              </h4>
<p>Every business line, country or significant sector of the Bank
                              defines periodically a risk strategy that is specific to it and consistent
                              with its financial objectives and its competitive positioning. These
                              risk strategies are approved by the Strategies and Portfolios Committee
                              (CSP) chaired by the Executive Management and, if necessary, by the
                              Group Risk Committee (CRG) chaired by the Executive Management of
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. for risk strategies which the shareholder wishes
                              to authorise at its level, and then lastly, in compliance with the
                              Ministerial Order of 3 November 2014, by the Board of Directors.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has also introduced Corporate Social Responsibility
                              (CSR) sector policies in cooperation with the Group as a whole to
                              manage the reputational risks stemming from the social and environmental
                              impacts of its activities. These policies set out analysis criteria
                              for these specific risks, which may cause Crédit Agricole CIB not
                              to perform a transaction which displays (or in some cases does not
                              display) certain (required or excluded) characteristics in certain
                              sectors such as armaments, nuclear or coal (see list on page 42).
                              Much like the specific risk strategies, these sector policies are
                              approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP) and then by
                              the Board of Directors.
                              </p>
<p>Ultimately, Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite therefore comprises
                              the following four components which form a coherent whole and incorporate
                              the Bank's commercial strategy:
                              </p>
<p>I. the overall risk strategy, which is expressed through qualitative
                              comments and key indicators broken down into three risk levels and
                              monitored quarterly;
                              </p>
<p>II. this concise statement;</p>
<p>III. the specific risk strategies (updated periodically);</p>
<p>IV. the sector policies.</p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">RISK TYPES:
                              CHOSEN RISKS AND IMPOSED RISKS
                              </h4>
<p>In order to meet its commercial and financial goals, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB selects the majority of its own risks: counterparty risks, market
                              risks and liquidity risks are taken on intentionally to generate income
                              and profit. Therefore, Crédit Agricole CIB defines its appetite by
                              ensuring that risks are in proportion with its commercial strategy
                              and financial objectives, taking into account its previous performance,
                              competitive position and the current economic cycle, while ensuring
                              that all regulatory requirements (particularly those related to solvency
                              and liquidity) are met.
                              </p>
<p>Other risks such as operational and certain non-compliance risks
                              are essentially imposed, although the implementation of protective
                              measures and control systems helps to limit these risks and their
                              potential consequences. The Bank has no appetite for these risks.
                              The Bank's appetite is therefore expressed through certain control
                              and watch list indicators, whose purpose is to reduce the impact of
                              these risks to a bare and tolerated minimum.

<p>The regulatory RWAs are used to calculate nearly all of Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's risks: credit risks, market risks and operational risks.
                              This key indicator fully expresses the overall quantity of risk that
                              the Bank is willing to take on (appetite), does not wish to exceed
                              under any circumstances (tolerance), and the maximum risk in accordance
                              with the regulatory constraints (capacity).
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2017, Crédit Agricole CIB's regulatory RWAs stood
                              at 112.0 billion euros (see page 219) and were below the Bank's tolerance
                              threshold.

<p>Short-term liquidity stress is applied based on crisis scenarios
                              that Crédit Agricole CIB believes that it could face should an event
                              affect the Group (idiosyncratic crisis), the whole of the interbank
                              market (systemic crisis), or a combination of the two (global crisis).
                              </p>
<p>The stable funding position, defined as a long-term surplus of
                              resources over long-term assets, aims to protect business lines from
                              the consequences of market stress. LCR came into force on 31 October
                              2015. This ratio requires the Bank to retain sufficient unencumbered
                              High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash
                              easily and immediately, on private markets, assuming a liquidity crisis
                              lasting 30 calendar days.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2017, all of these indicators were compliant with
                              the Bank's tolerance in this area. Note that the LCR percentage of
                              120% far exceeds the regulatory requirement of 80%.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2.2 Risks
                              specifically managed within the corporate and investment banking (CIB)
                              and wealth management business lines
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">• CREDIT</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's Corporate and Investment Banking is based
                              on debt-related business: credit risk is therefore central to its
                              activities and is by far the greatest risk. Like Crédit Agricole CIB's
                              competitors, CIB customers are often large multinationals or major
                              financial institutions which by their very nature, in addition to
                              individual creditworthiness issues, generate a concentration risk
                              in this area. This risk should however be put into perspective by
                              viewing the Crédit Agricole Group as a whole. The refocusing strategy
                              applied since the financial crisis slightly reduced the number of
                              counterparties and geographical sites, and therefore resulted in a
                              relative increase in the portfolio concentration. However the Bank
                              is still active in a large number of countries and economic sectors,
                              thus benefiting from the positive effect of sectoral and geographical
                              diversification. This effect is measured and monitored under ICAAP.
                              </p>
<p>On the other hand, Crédit Agricole CIB's Wealth Management (WM)
                              business line generates few credit risks, as the majority of its services
                              are Lombard loans which are secured against collateral such as: cash,
                              securities, life insurance contracts, etc.
                              </p>
<p>Therefore, Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite is defined in accordance
                              with three key indicators:
                              </p>

                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">• MARKET RISKS</h4>
<p>A series of refocusing and adaptation plans have reduced Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's market activity and the resulting risk. This redimensioning
                              plan followed the response to the financial crises of 2007-2008, and
                              then 2011, and the choice to discontinue activities which were deemed
                              to be non-strategic or below their critical size. Thus, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB disposed of the European (Cheuvreux) and Asian (CLSA) equity brokers,
                              together with its 50% stake in Newedge Group (derivatives brokerage).
                              It also ceased its commodity-related activities, stepped down from
                              its market-making role for credit derivatives and closed the majority
                              of its equity derivative activities. The Bank also suspended its own-account
                              activities and, under the French Banking Law (LBF), was not required
                              to set up an ad-hoc subsidiary. Finally, the Bank's Treasury Department
                              is responsible for the sound and prudent management of cash, as required
                              under the LBF.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has retained its appetite for market risks
                              in its CIB activities, when such risks are adopted by supplying corporate
                              customers and financial institutions with the investment products
                              and services that they require (including some structured products),
                              and by assuming its role as a market maker for certain market segments
                              and instruments. Wealth Management on the other hand is only exposed
                              to a very low level of market risks.
                              </p>
<p>Therefore, Crédit Agricole CIB's market risk appetite is defined
                              in accordance with two key indicators:
                              </p>

                              to administrative or disciplinary sanctions in the event of a failure

                              risk situations inherent to income generation by measuring the proportion

<p>A credit risk occurs when a counterparty is unable to fulfil its
                              obligations and when the book value of these obligations in the bank's
                              records is positive. The counterparty may be a bank, an industrial
                              or commercial corporate, a government or government entity, an investment
                              fund or an individual.
                              </p>
<p>The exposure may be a loan, debt security, deed of property, performance
                              exchange contract, guarantee or unused confirmed commitment. The risk
                              also includes the settlement risk inherent in any transaction entailing
                              an exchange of cash or physical goods outside a secure settlement
                              system.

                              and policy
                              </h4>
<p>Risk-taking in Crédit Agricole CIB is done through the definition
                              of risk strategies approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee
                              (CSP), chaired by Executive Management. The risk strategies are set
                              for each country, business/product line or sector carrying a significant
                              risk for the Bank within the scope of control of Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              They aim to define the principal risk guidelines and to establish
                              the risk budgets within which each business line or geographical entity
                              must conduct its activities, and cover: industrial sectors included
                              (or excluded), type of counterparty, nature and duration of transactions
                              and activities or authorised product types, category or intensity
                              of risks incurred, existence and value of guarantees, overall portfolio
                              volume, definition of individual and overall risk level, diversification
                              criteria.
                              </p>
<p>By establishing a risk strategy for each scope deemed significant
                              by Crédit Agricole CIB, each business sector and each country, the
                              Bank is able to define its risk appetite and quality criteria for
                              the commitments that it subsequently makes. It also prevents from
                              excessive concentrations and it leads to a risk diversification of
                              the portfolio profile.
                              </p>
<p>Concentration risks are managed by using specific indicators that
                              are taken into account when granting loans (individual concentration
                              grid). Concentrations are then monitored a posteriori for the affected
                              portfolios, by analysing the quantitative measure assigned to this
                              use, based on the Bank's internal model.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, an active portfolio management is done within Crédit Agricole
                              CIB to reduce main concentration risks and also to optimise its uses
                              of shareholders' equity. The ALM/CPM uses market instruments such
                              as credit derivatives or securitisation mechanisms to reduce and diversify
                              counterparty risks. The use of derivatives to manage credit risk entails
                              the purchase of credit derivatives on single exposures (see "Credit

                              purposes and the sale of senior exposure tranches to reduce the sensitivity
                              of the insurance portfolio (it should be noted that these reinvestment
                              transactions, whether singly or in tranches, are in attrition). Similarly,
                              the syndication of loans with external banks and the use of risk hedging
                              instruments (credit insurance, derivatives, etc.) are other methods
                              used to mitigate potential risk concentration.
                              </p>
<p>In particular, with respect to counterparty risk on market transactions,
                              the group's policy on credit reserves constitution is twofold. On
                              sound clients, a credit valuation adjustment ("CVA risk assessment")
                              is recorded and consists in a generic provisioning, as for credit
                              risk. Conversely, on defaulted counterparties, an individual provision
                              is sized in accordance with the derivative instrument situation, taking
                              into account the CVA amount already provisioned prior to the default.
                              </p>
<p>In case of default, the depreciation is assessed in accordance
                              with the same principles as those governing the credit risk provisioning
                              policy: expected loss amount depending on the derivative instrument
                              rank in the waterfall. But it takes into account the CVA process,
                              with two possible outcomes: either derivatives are left in place (CVA
                              or individual provision), or they are terminated (individual write-off).

<p>Credit decisions depend on the upstream risk strategies that are
                              defined above.
                              </p>
<p>Limits are set for all counterparties and groups of counterparties,
                              in order to control the amount of commitments, whatever the type of
                              counterparty (corporate, sovereign, banks, financial institutions,
                              local authorities, SPEs, etc.). Authorisations vary according to the
                              quality of the risk, assessed by an internal rating of the counterparty.
                              The credit decision must form part of the formally approved risk strategies.
                              </p>
<p>Second-level controls on compliance with limits are performed by
                              the "Risk and Permanent Control" Department, supplemented by a process
                              for monitoring individual and portfolio risks, notably to detect any
                              deterioration in the quality of counterparties and Crédit Agricole
                              CIB's commitments as early as possible.
                              </p>
<p>Where the risk is substantiated, a collective and specific impairment
                              policy is put into effect.
                              </p>
<p>New transactions are approved according to a decision-making process
                              based on two front-office signatures, one from a collaborator authorised
                              to make such a request and the other from a delegate empowered to
                              make a credit decision.
                              </p>
<p>The decision is supported by an independent opinion by the RPC
                              approved by an authorised RPC signatory and must take Basel II parameters
                              into account, including the internal rating of the counterparty and
                              the predictive Loss Given Default (LGD) attributed to the proposed
                              transactions. A calculation of ex ante profitability must also be
                              included in the credit file. In the event that the risk management
                              team's opinion is negative, the decision-making power is passed up
                              to Front-Office delegate who chairs the immediate higher committee.

                              SYSTEM
                              </h4>
<p>The internal rating system covers all methods, procedures and controls
                              used to calculate credit risk, borrower ratings and loss given default
                              figures for all of our exposures.
                              </p>
<p>In 2007, Crédit Agricole CIB received authorisation from the French
                              Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR) to use its
                              internal credit risk rating system to calculate regulatory capital
                              requirements.
                              </p>
<p>The methods used cover all types of counterparty and combine quantitative
                              and qualitative criteria. They are devised using the expertise of
                              the various financing activities within Crédit Agricole CIB, or within
                              the Crédit Agricole Group if they cover customers shared by the whole
                              Group. The rating scale has 15 notches. It has been established on
                              the basis of a segmentation of risk so as to provide a uniform view
                              of default risk over a full business cycle. The scale comprises 13
                              ratings (A+ to E-) for counterparties that are not in default (including
                              3 ratings for counterparties that have been placed under watch) and
                              2 ratings (F and Z) for counterparties that are in default.
                              </p>
<p>The relevance of ratings and reliability of data used are secured
                              by a process of initial validation and maintenance of internal models,
                              based on a structured and documented organisation applied to the Group
                              and involving the entities, the Risk and Permanent Control Department
                              and the Audit-Inspection business line.
                              </p>
<p>All internal models used by Crédit Agricole CIB were the subject
                              of a presentation to the Standards and Methodology Committee (CNM)
                              for approval before internal validation by the Control and Audit function.
                              They were also the subject of a validation by the ACPR on 1 January
                              2008. Furthermore, each change in the internal model is now subject
                              to an audit by the validation team within the Group Risk Management
                              Department before being presented to the CNM for approval.
                              </p>
<p>Corporates' internal rating is followed according to a system common
                              to Crédit Agricole Group; guaranteeing a uniform rating throughout
                              the Group and enabling to share backtesting work for common customers.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has ensured that the risk parameters required
                              by Basel II, allowing the calculation of capital requirements, are
                              used as part of the Bank's internal management. They are used by all
                              people involved in the process of granting loans and measuring and
                              monitoring credit risks.
                              </p>
<p>The data used for granting loans and determining ratings is monitored
                              every two months by a Basel Requirements Review Committee. This committee
                              is coordinated by the Risk Management Department, and representatives
                              of all business lines take part in it. The committee monitors a set
                              of indicators concerning the quality of the data used for rating purposes,
                              as well as the calculation of other Basel II parameters when granting
                              loans, such as loss given default (LGD), credit conversion factor
                              (CCF), risk reduction factor (RRF), etc. The committee helps business
                              lines apply Basel II requirements and, if necessary, to take remedial
                              action when discrepancies arise. It provides important help in checking
                              that the Basel II system is used properly by the business lines.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">BACKTESTING</h4>
<p>Backtesting aims to ensure the robustness, performance and predictive
                              power of the Bank's internal models over time. This exercise also
                              helps detecting significant changes in the structure and behaviour
                              of portfolios and clients. It then leads to adjustment decisions adjustment,
                              or even recast, of models in order to take into account these new
                              structural elements.

                              MEASUREMENT
                              </h4>
<p>The measurement of credit risk exposures includes both drawn facilities
                              and confirmed unutilised facilities. To measure counterparty risk
                              on capital markets transactions, Crédit Agricole CIB uses an internal
                              method for estimating the underlying risk of derivative financial
                              instruments such as swaps and structured products.
                              </p>
<p>Counterparty risks on capital market activities are assessed for
                              potential risk linked to fluctuations in the market value of derivative
                              instruments for the remainder of their life. This is determined according
                              to the nature and remaining maturity of agreements, based on a statistical
                              observation of changes to underlyings. When the netting and collateralisation
                              agreements with the counterparty allow, counterparty risk is measured
                              for the portfolio net of eligible collateral. The Corporate and Investment
                              business uses this method for the internal management of counterparty
                              risk, and it differs from the regulatory approach used to meet the
                              measurement requirements of European, and international capital adequacy
                              ratios or for reporting major risks.
                              </p>
<p>To reduce exposure to counterparty risks, the Corporate and Investment
                              business enters into netting and collateralisation agreements with
                              its counterparties (see part 2.4 "Credit risk mitigation mechanism").

<p>Decision-making and individual risk monitoring within Crédit Agricole

                              for each of the constituent sub-portfolios, according to a breakdown
                              by business line, sector, geographic zone, or any delineation that
                              brings out specific risk characteristics in the overall portfolio.
                              </p>
<p>In principle, portfolio reviews are conducted yearly on each significant
                              scope in order to check that the portfolio is consistent with the
                              risk strategy in force, to assess the various segments of the portfolio
                              against one another and against any aspects of the operating environment

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB uses credit risk modelling tools and in particular
                              an internal portfolio model that calculates risk indicators such as:
                              average loss, volatility of potential losses and economic capital.
                              Average loss and volatility figures enable Crédit Agricole CIB to
                              anticipate the average risk-related cost in its portfolio, and changes
                              therein. Economic capital is an additional measurement of Basel II
                              regulatory capital, to the extent that it allows a more detailed view
                              of the portfolio through a correlation model and parameters calibrated
                              using internal data bases.
                              </p>
<p>The internal portfolio model also takes into account the impact
                              of protection (Credit Default Swaps, securitisations) purchased by
                              Crédit Agricole CIB's Credit Portfolio Management unit. Finally, it
                              measures the effects of concentration and diversification within our
                              portfolio. These effects are studied based on individual and geo-sectorial
                              criteria.

<p>Stress scenarios are the final type of counterparty risk assessment
                              tool. They are regularly produced to estimate the impact of economic
                              scenarios (central, adverse) on some or all parts of the portfolio.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">SECTOR RISKS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's portfolio is analysed by major industrial
                              sector at regular intervals. Risks within each sector in terms of
                              commitments, level of risk (expected loss, economic capital) and concentration
                              are examined.
                              </p>
<p>Concentration is assessed on two levels: idiosyncratic and geo-sectorial.
                              These analyses can be more or less deepened according to the analyst's
                              needs.
                              </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the economic and financial risks of each significant
                              sector are analysed and leading indicators of deterioration are monitored.
                              </p>
<p>Specific stress scenarios are also prepared when necessary for
                              instance during the strategic review of an entity of the Bank.
                              </p>
<p>In the light of these various analyses, measures to diversify or
                              protect sectors at risk of deterioration are recommended.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">COUNTRY RISKS</h4>
<p>Country risk is the risk that economic, financial, political, legal
                              or social conditions of a foreign country will affect the Bank's financial
                              interests. It does not differ in nature from "elementary" risks (credit,
                              market and operational risks). It constitutes a set of risks resulting
                              from the Bank's vulnerability to a specific political, social, macroeconomic
                              and financial environment.
                              </p>
<p>The system for assessing and monitoring country risk within Crédit
                              Agricole CIB is based on an internal rating model. Internal country
                              ratings are based on criteria relating to the financial soundness
                              of the government, the banking system and the economy, ability and
                              willingness to pay, governance and political stability.
                              </p>
<p>The limits set at the end of 2011 for all countries with a sufficiently
                              high volume of business, in line with procedures which are more or
                              less stringent depending on the country's rating, were introduced
                              in early 2013: country limits are set on an annual basis for "non-investment
                              grade" rated countries and are reviewed every two years for countries
                              with higher ratings.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, the Bank performs scenario analysis to test adverse
                              macroeconomic and financial assumptions, which give an integrated
                              overview of the risks to which it may be exposed in situations of
                              extreme tension.
                              </p>
<p>The Group manages and controls its country risks according to the

                              </p>
<p>The model also takes into account various risk mitigation factors,
                              linked to set-off and collateralisation contracts negotiated with
                              counterparties during the pre-transaction documentation phase. It
                              also includes exchanges of collateral on the initial margin for non-cleared
                              derivatives, in accordance with the thresholds in force.
                              </p>
<p>Situations of specific risk of unfavourable correlations (risk
                              that an exposure to a derivative is positively correlated with the
                              counterparty's probability of default as a result of a legal tie between
                              this counterparty and the underlying of the derivative) are monitored
                              regularly to identify and integrate such risks in the exposure measurement
                              as recommended by regulations. Situations of general risk of unfavourable
                              correlations (risk that market conditions have a correlated effect
                              on a counterparty's credit quality and derivative exposures with this
                              counterparty) are monitored by means of ad hoc exercises in 2017.
                              The internal model is used to manage internal limits on transactions
                              with each counterparty and to calculate Basel II Pillar 2 economic
                              capital via the average risk profile (Expected Positive Exposure)
                              using a global portfolio approach.

<p>As allowed by the regulatory framework, the French Regulatory and
                              Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR) authorised Crédit Agricole
                              CIB as of 31 March 2014 to use the internal model method to calculate
                              its capital requirements in respect of counterparty risk. This method
                              uses the model described above to determine Effective Expected Positive
                              Exposure (EEPE) and is applied to all derivatives. The same method
                              is used to calculate credit exposure at default for capital requirement
                              purposes to address the risk of credit value adjustment.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB uses the standard approach for the calculation
                              of regulatory capital requirements in respect of counterparty risk
                              on repo transactions and derivative transactions at its subsidiaries.
                              </p>
<p>Credit risk on these market transactions is managed following rules
                              set by the Group. The policy on setting counterparty risk limits is
                              as described in "Credit risk management - General principles of risk-taking"
                              on page 169. The techniques used by Crédit Agricole CIB to reduce
                              counterparty risk on market transactions are described in "Credit
                              risk mitigation mechanisms" on pages 249 to 251.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB includes a credit valuation adjustment (CVA)
                              in its calculation of the fair value of derivative assets. This value
                              adjustment is described in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial
                              statements under accounting principles and policies and Note 10.2

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB requires guarantees and collateral from a significant
                              number of its counterparties to reduce its risks, either on financing

                              and managing guarantees and collateral are defined by the Crédit Agricole

<p>This common framework ensures a consistent approach across the

                              AGREEMENTS
                              </h4>
<p>With the implementation of the recommendations of the Basel Committee
                              along with the CRD IV European Directive on regulatory capital, the
                              French Regulatory and Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR) requires
                              that several conditions have to be strictly respected in order to
                              trigger a close out netting within the framework of determining the
                              regulatory shareholder's equity of a financial institution.
                              </p>
<p>These conditions include: Crédit Agricole CIB obtaining recent
                              written and reasoned legal opinions as well as proceedings "in order
                              to ensure at any time the validity of the novation settlement or the
                              netting agreement in the event that applicable regulations are revised".
                              </p>
<p>The close out netting corresponds to the possibility, in case of
                              default from the counterparty (including the case of an opening of
                              a bankruptcy proceeding) of early cancelling the contract and calculating
                              a full settlement of debts and reciprocal obligations according to
                              a calculus method that would have been contractually worked out.
                              </p>
<p>Thus, the close out netting is an anticipated termination-compensation
                              mechanism which can be separated in three steps:

                              be netted in case of a default from a counterparty, in order to determine

                              from a master agreement that would have been signed with the counterparty.

<p>Credit derivatives are handled with around ten bank counterparties

<p>These credit derivative transactions, carried out as part of the

<p>2017 was marked by the recovery of global growth in both emerging
                              and developed economies, which encouraged business development, although
                              it remains difficult to perceive the impact of this upturn in view
                              of the EUR/USD exchange rate and the fact that our emerging economies
                              portfolio is largely denominated in USD.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, the Bank reviewed its strategies and limits for 59 countries
                              in which it serves its customers, as well those of its 22 business
                              lines and sectors. It also reviewed 23 country portfolios and 18 business
                              lines, and updated its country and sovereign ratings quarterly.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">OUTLOOK FOR
                              2018
                              </h4>
<p>The upturn in global trade and growth continues and the markets
                              remain optimistic, although there are risks on the horizon.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, global growth continued on the road to recovery commenced
                              halfway through 2016. Growth has increased by half a percentage above
                              the 2016 rate, and follows the trend of increasing trade. This recovery
                              can be seen in most of the world's major economies where forecasts
                              have been exceeded: USA, Italy and Germany among the developed countries,
                              and Brazil, Russia, India and Turkey among the emerging economies.
                              The IMF anticipates that this momentum will continue throughout 2018
                              in the presence of more accommodating global financial conditions
                              that support consumer spending and investment.
                              </p>
<p>However, there are a number of risks on the horizon in the medium
                              term, not least the possibility of a correction across asset markets,
                              given that the relative weight of debt, both public and private, is
                              increasing at historical highs worldwide. Next, there is another major
                              risk associated with the reconsideration or renegotiation of free
                              trade agreements (Brexit, NAFTA). It is widely feared that raising
                              tariff walls will hamper investment and reduce potential global growth.
                              Finally, non-economic risks, of which there are several, constitute
                              a growing threat to global growth: geopolitical risk in Asia, the
                              Middle East and in Eastern Europe, in particular, but also uncertainties
                              associated with various elections (Brazil, Italy, Algeria, etc.) and
                              climate risk, which could destabilise countries and generate major
                              migratory crises.
                              </p>
<p>Against this potentially more favourable backdrop, Crédit Agricole
                              will continue to maintain its active role vis-à-vis its local and
                              international customers and will continue to help them develop their
                              businesses both at home and abroad, whilst ensuring that all applicable

                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB continued its work on rolling out a Market
                              Risk ecosystem to meet the requirements of the Fundamental Review
                              of the Trading Book that is also compatible with BCBS 239.
                              </p>
<p>Following the latest recommendations from the Basel Committee,
                              the ECB has produced a provisional timetable for implementation of
                              the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) for European Banks
                              which will come into force in 2022. This prospect requires that the
                              approach be implemented in an internal model by the fourth quarter
                              of 2019 in order to have the necessary historical data available for
                              different validation audits (internal model validation, internal audit
                              and ECB audit).
                              </p>
<p>In this respect, the implementation of the market risk system in
                              the new MASAI/FRTB ecosystem, in accordance with BCBS239 guidelines,
                              has been prioritised for 2018 and 2019. It includes the following
                              elements: implementation of data management principles, centralisation
                              of valuation methods, production of market risk metrics and systems
                              for the analysis and control of those metrics.

<p>VaR is calculated daily on all positions. It represents the potential
                              future loss with a 99% confidence interval. Since VaR does not recognise
                              extreme market conditions, it should not be confused with the concept
                              of maximum loss. Stressed VaR and stress scenarios are used in addition
                              to this system in order to measure these extreme risks.

<p>If the historical data used to calculate VaR shocks originate in
                              low-volatility market situations, the resulting VaR will have a low
                              level. To compensate for this pro-cyclical bias, the regulator introduced
                              the stressed VaR.
                              </p>
<p>Stressed VaR is calculated using the "initial" VaR model for a
                              confidence interval of 99% and a one-day horizon, and over a period
                              of stress that corresponds to the most severe period for the most

<p>Stress tests were developed to assess the ability of financial
                              institutions to withstand a shock to their activities. This shock
                              may be economic (economic downturn for example) or geopolitical (conflict
                              between countries).
                              </p>
<p>To satisfy regulatory requirements and complete its VaR measurements,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB thus applies stress scenarios to its market activities
                              in order to determine the impact of particularly strong (and unpredictable
                              or difficult to categorise) disruptions on the value of its accounts.
                              These scenarios are developed using three complementary approaches:
                              </p>

<p>Between 2016 and 2017, stresses of all kinds remained broadly similar,
                              extreme adverse stress having reached an average €268 million in 2017
                              versus €258 million in 2016 while adverse stress remained, on average,
                              at a level equivalent to that of 2016 at €92 million. This stability
                              in the observed stress levels reflects the continuity of Crédit Agricole

                              REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE IRC, STANDARD METHOD
                              </h4>
<p>The Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) is an additional capital requirement
                              on so-called linear credit positions (i.e. excluding credit correlation
                              positions), required by the regulator in CRD III following the subprime
                              crisis.
                              </p>
<p>The purpose of the IRC is to quantify unexpected losses caused
                              by credit events affecting issuers, i.e. defaults or rating migrations
                              (both upgrades and downgrades). In other words, the IRC recognises
                              two risk measures:
                              </p>
<p>1. Default risk (potential gains and losses due to the default
                              of the issuer);
                              </p>
<p>2. Migration risk, which represents potential gains and losses
                              following a migration of the issuer's credit rating and the impact
                              of related spreads.
                              </p>
<p>The IRC is calculated with a confidence interval of 99.9% over
                              a one-year risk horizon using Monte Carlo simulations.
                              </p>
<p>The simulated default and credit migration scenarios are then valued
                              using Crédit Agricole CIB pricing models. The range of Mark-to-Market
                              valuations provides a distribution, from which a 99.9% confidence
                              level calculation makes it possible to determine the IRC.
                              </p>
<p>At the end of December 2017, the capital requirements related to
                              the IRC totalled €172 million.

<p>The final measure required by the supervisory authorities is the

                              REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO PRUDENT VALUATION
                              </h4>
<p>In accordance with CRD IV, the Basel III Committee requires that
                              each bank calculate a "prudent valuation" on the assumption that fair
                              value recognition does not always provide a prudent measure. The purpose
                              of the prudent valuation is therefore to define a detailed framework
                              of independent accounting standards making it possible to value all
                              trading and banking book positions recognised at fair value with a
                              90% confidence interval.
                              </p>
<p>Prudent Valuation is defined as a set of nine additional valuation
                              adjustments (AVA): market price uncertainty, close-out costs, model
                              risk, concentrated positions, unearned credit spreads, investing and
                              funding costs, early termination, future administrative costs and
                              operational risks. All of these various categories are then aggregated
                              and deducted from Common Equity Tier 1.
                              </p>
<p>The calculation of valuation adjustments based on regulatory requirements
                              had an impact of €532 million on capital at the end of December 2017.

<p>Global interest rate risk or interest rate risk on the banking
                              book of a financial institution is the risk incurred when a change
                              in interest rates occurs, as a result of all balance sheet and off-balance
                              sheet transactions, except transactions subject to market risk.

                              </h4>
<p>Global interest-rate risk management aims to protect commercial
                              margins against rate variations and to ensure a better stability over
                              time of the equity and long-term financing components' intrinsic value.
                              </p>
<p>The intrinsic value and the interest margin are linked to the sensitivity
                              in the interest-rate variation of the net present value and in cash
                              flow variation of the financial instruments in the on and off balance
                              sheet. This sensitivity arises when assets and liabilities have different
                              maturities and dates for interest-rate refixing.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ METHOD</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB uses the gap method (fixed rate) to measure
                              its global interest rate risk.
                              </p>
<p>This consists of determining maturity schedules and interest rates
                              for all assets, liabilities and hedging derivatives at fixed or adjustable
                              interest rates:

</td>

<p>The gap measurement includes the rate hedging effect on fair value
                              and cash flow hedges.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ EXPOSURE</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's risk exposure to interest rate risk on retail
                              operations is limited because of the rate backing rule for each instance
                              of customer financing by Treasury and market teams.
                              </p>
<p>The interest rate risk mainly comes from capital, investments,
                              modelling of unpaid liabilities, and from maturities under one year
                              of the banking book's Treasury activities.
                              </p>
<p>The Group is mainly exposed to the Euro zone and, to a lesser extent
                              US Dollar, interest rate variation.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB manages its interest rate risk exposure within
                              a range defined by Crédit Agricole S.A.: €8 billion up to 2 years,
                              €1.5 billion up to 3 years, €1.25 billion up to 4 years, €1 billion
                              up to 5 years, and €0.75 billion up to 10 years. Crédit Agricole CIB
                              also has an overall limit in Net Present Value (NPV) all currencies
                              defined by Crédit Agricole S.A. amounting to €350 million.
                              </p>
<p>Interest-rate gaps measure the surplus or deficit of fixed-rate
                              resources. Conventionally, a positive gap represents an exposure to
                              a risk of falling interest rates during the period.
                              </p>
<p>The results of these measurements at 31 December 2017 reflect that
                              Crédit Agricole CIB is exposed to a fall in interest rates.

<p>In terms of net banking income sensitivity for the first year (2018),
                              Crédit Agricole CIB could lose €14 million of revenues in case of
                              a long-term 200-basis-point decrease in interest rates, i.e. a 0.28%
                              sensitivity for a reference net banking income of €4,999 million in
                              2017.
                              </p>
<p>Based on these same sensitivity calculations, the net present value
                              of the loss incurred in the next ten years in the event of an adverse
                              200-basis-point movement in the yield curve equals 0.41% of the Group's
                              prudential capital.

<p>Simulations are made using the sensitivity of Crédit Agricole CIB's
                              interest-rate mismatch. Sensitivity is defined as the gain or loss
                              arising from a 2% change in interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated
                              in EUR and USD. The calculation is based on average outstandings.
                              </p>
<p>The shocks contained in these scenarios are calculated on a 10-day
                              basis, according to Crédit Agricole CIB's stress scenario methodology.
                              Sensitivity is "shocked" in various ways. The result of a stress test
                              corresponds to the net present value of changes in the scenario's
                              characteristics.

<p>These stress scenarios display relatively limited impacts, since

<p>The foreign exchange risk is the financial risk associated with

                              It is primarily assessed by measuring net residual exposure, taking
                              into account gross foreign exchange positions and hedging and differentially

                              </h4>
<p>The Group's structural foreign exchange risk results from its other
                              than temporary investments in assets denominated in foreign currencies,
                              mainly the equity of its foreign operating entities, whether they
                              result from acquisitions, transfers of funds from head office or the
                              capitalisation of local earnings.
                              </p>
<p>In most cases, the Group's policy is to borrow the currency in
                              which the investment is made in order to immunise that investment
                              from currency risk. These borrowings are documented as investment
                              hedging instruments. In some cases, particularly for illiquid currencies,
                              the investment gives rise to sales and purchases of the local currency.
                              Foreign exchange risk is then hedged, if possible, through forward
                              transactions.
                              </p>
<p>Overall, the Group's main gross structural foreign exchange positions
                              are denominated in US dollars, in US dollar-linked currencies (mainly
                              Middle Eastern and some Asian currencies), in sterling and in Swiss
                              franc.

<p>The aim is to protect the intrinsic value of fixed-rate financial
                              assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates,
                              by hedging them with instruments that are also at fixed rate. When
                              hedging takes place through derivatives (swaps), the derivatives are
                              termed fair value hedge derivatives.
                              </p>
<p>Hedging carried out in this respect by Asset and Liability Management
                              relates to non-interest-bearing Wealth Management customer deposits,

<p>The second aim is to protect interest margin so that interest flows
                              generated by variable-rate assets financed by fixed-rate liabilities
                              (working capital in particular) are not affected by the future fixing
                              of interest rates on these items.
                              </p>
<p>When the required neutralisation takes place through derivatives
                              (swaps), these derivatives are termed cash flow hedge derivatives.
                              According to IFRS 7, future interests related to balance sheet items

<p>As regards macro-hedges managed by Asset and Liability Management,
                              hedge relationships are documented from inception and checked quarterly
                              through forward and backward looking tests.
                              </p>
<p>For this purpose, hedged items are classified by maturity, using
                              the characteristics of contracts or, for items without contractual
                              maturities (such as demand deposits), runoff models based on each
                              product's behaviour. The comparison between this maturity schedule
                              and that of the derivative instrument allows the efficiency of the
                              hedging to be assessed.

                              Crédit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and
                              its compliance programs regarding laws on international sanctions
                              and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York authorities
                              regarding this matter, with its home regulators, the European Central
                              Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority
                              (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.

<p>Pursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve,
                              Crédit Agricole's compliance program is subject to regular reviews
                              to evaluate its effectiveness, including a review by an independent

                              AND OTHER INDEXES
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A.,
                              in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank rates,
                              have received requests for information from a number of authorities
                              as part of investigations into: (i) the calculation of the Libor (London
                              Interbank Offered Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro
                              Interbank Offered Rate) and certain other market indices; and (ii)
                              transactions connected with these rates and indices. These demands
                              covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its cooperation with the authorities, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out investigations
                              in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities
                              and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of
                              Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with which
                              they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the
                              outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Crédit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation
                              opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the
                              Libor and the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>Following its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure,
                              on 21 May 2014, the European Commission sent a notification of grievances
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A. and to Crédit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements
                              or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing,
                              restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the
                              Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>In a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly
                              fined Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB €114,654,000 for
                              participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are challenging this decision
                              and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn it.
                              </p>
<p>Additionally, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, is conducting
                              an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including
                              the Euribor, with regard to Crédit Agricole S.A. and several Swiss
                              and international banks. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition
                              authority (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September
                              2015 into Crédit Agricole CIB and the Libor index on various currencies,
                              Euribor and Tibor indices. The KFTC investigation into certain foreign
                              exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) is ongoing.

<p>Concerning the two class actions in the United States of America
                              in which Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have been named
                              since 2012 and 2013 along with other financial institutions, both
                              as defendants in one ("Sullivan" for the Euribor) and only Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ("Lieberman" for Libor),
                              the "Lieberman" class action is at the preliminary stage that consists
                              in the examination of its admissibility; proceedings are still suspended
                              before the US District Court of New York State. Concerning the "Sullivan"
                              class action, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB introduced
                              a motion to dismiss the applicants' claim. The US District Court of
                              New York State upheld the motion to dismiss regarding Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB in first instance. This decision is subject
                              to appeal. Since 1 July 2016, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action
                              suit in the United States ("Frontpoint") relating to the SIBOR (Singapore
                              Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indices.
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to
                              dismiss. The New York Federal Court, ruling in first instance, granted
                              this request last August 18th, in favor of Crédit Agricole S.A. and
                              Crédit Agricole CIB. Following federal procedure which allows them
                              to do so, the plaintiffs modified the terms of their action to refer
                              the case to the judge again. As a consequence, Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and Crédit Agricole CIB have submitted a new motion to dismiss, which
                              must be examined by the New York Federal Court soon.
                              </p>
<p>These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim
                              that they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor,
                              SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek repayment of the sums they allege were
                              unlawfully received, as well as damages and reimbursement of costs
                              and fees paid.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ AWSA II</h4>
<p>On 5 June 2015, action was brought against Crédit Agricole Corporate
                              and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole CIB) in the Nanterre commercial
                              court by Polish companies Autostrada Wielkopolska II SA (AWSA II)
                              and Autostrada Wielkopolska SA (AWSA). On 30 August 2008, AWSA and
                              the Polish Infrastructure Minister signed an Agreement for the Construction
                              and Operation of section 2 of the A2 motorway in Poland. AWSA II,
                              to which AWSA assigned the rights to this concession until March 2037,
                              claims to have suffered financial loss caused by Crédit Agricole CIB
                              due to way in which the transaction financing was structured and is
                              claiming 702.84 million zlotys (PLN) in damages, the equivalent of
                              about €168.579 million. At the 19 October 2016 hearing, the Nanterre
                              Commercial Court ordered a stay of proceedings pending the final decision
                              of the Polish courts in the case between AWSA II and the company that
                              audited the financial model.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ BONDS SSA</h4>
<p>Several regulators have demanded information to Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and to Crédit Agricole CIB for inquiries relating to activities
                              of different banks involved on Bonds SSA market (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign
                              and Agencies). Crédit Agricole CIB is included with other banks in

                              Court for the Southern District of New York. Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and Crédit Agricole CIB are included with other banks in two class
                              actions filed in Canada, one before the Ontario Superior Court of
                              Justice and the other before the Federal Court. Through the cooperation
                              with these regulators, Crédit Agricole CIB proceeded to internal inquiries
                              to gather the required information. It is not possible at this stage
                              to predict the outcome of these investigations or class actions or

<p>On November 9, 2017, a group of individuals, (or their families

                              </p>
<p>The Complaint alleges that Crédit Agricole S.A., Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, and other defendants conspired with Iran and its agents to violate

                              Crédit Agricole CIB, and other defendants processed US dollar transactions
                              on behalf of Iran and Iranian entities in violation of sanctions administered

                              which allegedly enabled Iran to fund terrorist organizations that,

                              The Compliance Department has been closely involved in the main development
                              projects and organisational changes at the Bank to identify and address

<p>Tightening up the regulatory framework, the Basel III agreements
                              have enhanced the quality and level of regulatory capital required
                              and have added new risk categories to the regulatory framework. The
                              legislation concerning the regulatory prudential requirements applicable
                              to credit institutions and investment firms was published in the Official
                              Journal of the European Union on 26 June 2013 (Directive 2013/36/EU,
                              known as "CRD 4", transposed notably by Order No 2014-158 of 20 February
                              2014 and Regulation "CRR") and entered into force on 1 January 2014,
                              in accordance with the transitional provisions specified in the legislation.
                              </p>
<p>Under the CRR/CRD 4 regime, three solvency ratios are calculated:</p>

</table>
<p>These ratios are calculated on a phase-in basis designed to smooth
                              the transition from the Basel II to the Basel III calculation rules
                              until 1 January 201 8 (and until 1 January 2022 for hybrid instruments).
                              See "Transitional provisions" on page 205.
                              </p>
<p>Two other ratio groups are added to this system:</p>

</table>
<p>Each of these ratios shows the relationship between a regulatory
                              capital amount to a risk exposure. The definitions and calculations
                              are set forth in the following sections. The minimum requirements
                              applicable to Crédit Agricole CIB are met.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.2 Supervision</h4>
<p>Credit institutions and certain approved investment activities
                              referred to in Annex 1 to Directive 2004/39/EC are subject to solvency
                              and large exposure ratios on an individual and, where applicable,
                              "sub-group" basis.
                              </p>
<p>The French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (Autorité
                              de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution - ACPR) has agreed that certain
                              Group subsidiaries qualify for this exemption on an individual basis,
                              under the terms set forth in Article 7 of the CRR. In that regard,
                              the ACPR has provided Crédit Agricole CIB with an exemption on an
                              individual basis.
                              </p>
<p>The transition to sole supervision by the European Central Bank
                              on 4 November 2014 did not call into question the individual exemptions
                              previously granted by the ACPR.

<p>These buffers come into force on an incremental basis from 1 January

                              The buffer for systemic risk can be implemented by a national authority
                              if it provides documentary evidence to the European Banking Authority.
                              When the countercyclical buffer rate is changed at the country level
                              in a country where the company does business, the application date
                              must be at least 12 months after the date the change was published.
                              In 2017, only Norway, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Iceland and Slovakia
                              have defined a contracyclical buffer. The increments above apply at
                              the end of the 12-month advance notice period.

<p>Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital eligible under Basel III consists
                              of perpetual debt instruments without any redemption incentive or
                              obligation (in particular step-up features).
                              </p>
<p>AT1 instruments must be subject to a loss absorption mechanism
                              triggered when the CET1 ratio falls below a threshold of at least
                              5.75%. The instruments may be converted into shares or written down.
                              Payments must be completely flexible: no automatic remuneration mechanisms
                              allowed, suspension of coupon payments at the issuer's discretion
                              permitted.
                              </p>
<p>Equity instruments in financial sector entities related to this
                              compartment (AT1) are deducted along with those resulting from transitional
                              application rules.

<p>The following table shows the stock of AT1 with issues eligible
                              under Basel III, conducted since 2015 and those not eligible after
                              maturities and redemptions, but excluding the impact of the cap resulting
                              from the grandfathering provision.
                              </p>
<p>The Basel III eligible issue has two loss absorption mechanisms
                              that are triggered when Crédit Agricole CIB Group's phased-in CET1
                              ratio drops below 5.75%.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB Group's phased-in CET1 ratio was 12.0% at 31
                              December 2017. They accordingly represent a capital buffer of €7 billion
                              relative to the loss absorption thresholds.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2017, there was no applicable restriction on the
                              payment of coupons.

                              PROVISIONS
                              </h4>
<p>To make it easier for credit institutions to comply with CRR/CRD
                              IV, certain requirements were relaxed on a transitional basis, notably
                              the gradual introduction of new capital component:
                              </p>
<p>1. Transitional application of the treatment of prudential Alters
                              on unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets
                              (as of 31 December 2016, the provisions of ECB Regulation 2016/445
                              replaces the national provisions indicated by the ACPR in its communication
                              of 12 December 2013): progressive integration into CET1 of unrealised
                              capital gains and losses on sovereign debt issues (40% in 2015; 60%
                              in 2016; 80% in 2017 and 100% in the following years). Conversely,
                              unrealised capital losses on other issuers have been included from
                              2014.
                              </p>
<p>2. Progressive deduction of the partial derecognition or exclusion
                              of minority interests by tranche rising by 20% per annum with effect
                              from 1 January 2015; the CRD III method is still applied to the remaining
                              amount (20% in 2017).
                              </p>
<p>3. Progressive deduction of Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) that rely
                              on future profitability arising from tax loss carryforwards by tranche
                              rising by 20% per annum with effect from 1 January 2014. The residual
                              amount (20% in 2017) remains subject to the CRD III treatment method
                              (0% risk weighting).
                              </p>
<p>4. No transitional application of the deduction of negative amounts
                              arising from insufficient provisions relative to the expected loss
                              (it should be noted that under CRD III the deduction was 50% of Tier
                              1 and 50% of Tier 2 capital), with the amounts calculated now distinguishing
                              between performing loans and receivables and those in default.
                              </p>
<p>5. Progressive deduction of Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) that rely
                              on future profitability arising from temporary differences: the amount
                              that exceeds the dual exemption threshold that is partially common
                              to equity investments greater than 1 0% is deducted by tranche, increasing
                              by 20% per annum with effect from 1 January 2014. The items covered
                              by the exemption thresholds are weighted 250%. The residual amount
                              exceeding the exemption (20% in 2017) remains subject to the CRD III
                              method (0% risk weighting).
                              </p>
<p>6. Gradual deduction of CET1 instruments held in significant financial
                              entities constituting equity investments in which the holding rate
                              is over 10%: the residual amount by which the dual exemption threshold
                              common to the deferred tax assets referred to in the previous point
                              is exceeded is deducted according to the same approaches as described
                              above. The items covered by the exemption are also risk-weighted at
                              250%. The residual amount exceeding the exemption (20% in 2017) remains
                              subject to the CRD III method (deduction of 50% of Tier 1 and 50%
                              of Tier 2 capital).
                              </p>
<p>7. The hybrid debt instruments that were eligible to capital under
                              Basel II and which are no longer eligible as capital owing to the
                              entry into force of the new regulation can, under certain conditions,
                              be eligible to the grandfathering clause. Under this clause, these
                              instruments are gradually excluded over an eight-year period, with
                              a 10% reduction each year. In 2017, 50% of the declared global inventories
                              at 31 December 2012 are recognised, then 40% in 2018, etc. The derecognised
                              portion may be recognised in the lowest tier of capital (from AT1
                              to Tier 2, for example) if it meets the corresponding criteria.
                              </p>
<p>Lastly, intangible assets (including goodwill) are 100%-deducted

                              RATIO
                              </h4>
<p>Article 429 of the CRR specifying the methods for calculating the
                              leverage ratio was amended and replaced by the Delegated Act No 2015/62
                              of 10 October 2014. The delegated act was published in the OJEU on
                              18 January 2015.
                              </p>
<p>Publication of the ratio at least once a year is mandatory as of
                              1 January 2015. Institutions can choose to publish a fully loaded
                              ratio, a phased-in ratio or both ratios.
                              </p>
<p>If the institution decides to change its publication choice, at
                              the time of first publication it must reconcile the data for all of
                              the ratios previously published with the data for the new ratios selected
                              for publication.
                              </p>
<p>An observation period has been introduced for the leverage ratio
                              running from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2017 to monitor the components
                              and the behaviour of the ratio relative to the requirements based
                              on risk.
                              </p>
<p>The implementation under Pillar 1 is delayed, and could be done
                              as part of its implementation in CRR2.
                              </p>
<p>A requirement for a two-level leverage ratio is advocated by the
                              Basel Committee: it could be 3% for non-G-SIBs, and at a level of
                              3% plus half of the entity's systemic risk buffer for G-SIBs.
                              </p>
<p>The leverage ratio is defined as the Tier 1 capital divided by
                              the exposure measure, i.e. balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets
                              after certain restatements of derivatives, intragroup transactions,
                              securities financing transactions, items deducted from the numerator,
                              and off-balance-sheet items.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2017, Crédit Agricole CIB's leverage ratio stood
                              at 3.68% on a phased-in Tier 1 basis (subject to ECB authorization,
                              with an impact of +14 basis points related to the exoneration of operations
                              between affiliated Group entities).

                              OF THE PROCEDURES USED TO MANAGE THE RISK OF EXCESSIVE LEVERAGE_
                              </h4>
<p>The leverage ratio is not sensitive to risk factors and, on this
                              basis, it is considered to be a measurement that supplements the solvency
                              and liquidity risk management system (solvency ratio/ resolution ratio)
                              already limiting the size of the balance sheet. Within the framework
                              of monitoring excessive leverage, controls at Group level set limits
                              on the size of the balance sheet for some businesses that use few
                              risk-weighted assets.

<p>The leverage ratio is impacted by the reduction in phased-in capital

                              with changes in scope following acquisitions and the growth in deposits
                              to central banks.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB considers the leverage ratio as an additional
                              measure to the constraints that weigh on solvency and liquidity, and
                              that already limit the size of the balance sheet. As part of the process
                              of monitoring excess leverage, constraints are actively managed. Crédit

                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">MREL RATIO</h4>
<p>The Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities
                              (MREL) ratio is defined in the European Bank Recovery and Resolution
                              Directive (BRRD) published on 12 June 2014 and effective from 1 January
                              2015 (with the exception of the provisions on bail-in and MREL, which
                              became applicable in 2016).
                              </p>
<p>More generally, the BRRD establishes a framework for the resolution
                              of banks throughout the European Union and with the aim of equipping
                              resolution authorities with shared instruments and powers to pre-emptively
                              tackle banking crises, preserve financial stability and reduce taxpayers'
                              exposure to losses.
                              </p>
<p>The MREL ratio corresponds to the minimum requirement of own funds
                              and eligible commitments in order to absorb losses in the event of
                              resolution. This minimum requirement is calculated as the amount of
                              own funds and eligible liabilities express as a percentage of the
                              institution's total liabilities and own funds. In this calculation,
                              total liabilities takes into account the full recognition of offsetting
                              rights applicable to derivatives. In view of the European Commission's
                              legislative proposal of amendments to the BRRD published on 23 November
                              2016, the denominator of the MREL may in the long term converge towards
                              that of the TLAC ratio (see below), and be expressed in RWA. Regulatory
                              capital, subordinated notes with a residual maturity of more than
                              one year (including prudentially ineligible instruments and the amortised
                              portion of Tier 2) and preferred and non-preferred senior debts with
                              residual maturities of more than one year (at the end of the reporting
                              period, Crédit Agricole CIB issued €650 and €600 million respectively
                              at 5 and 7 years) qualify for inclusion in the MREL. MREL eligible
                              preferred senior debt is subject to the appreciation of the Single
                              Resolution Board (SRB).
                              </p>
<p>The MREL ratio calibrates an eligible liabilities requirement but
                              does not specify which debt would be called upon to absorb losses
                              in the event of resolution.
                              </p>
<p>Since September 2015, Crédit Agricole Group has already reached
                              a MREL ratio of 8% excluding preferred senior debt, which, in the
                              event of resolution, would enable recourse to the European resolution
                              fund before applying the bail-in to preferred senior debt, creating
                              an additional layer of protection for preferred senior investors.
                              Crédit Agricole CIB will be subject to a MREL objective to be set
                              by the resolution authorities that might be different to the 8% target
                              chosen by the Group. In 2016, the SRB only gave the Group a guideline
                              for the MREL target that was not binding at the consolidated level.
                              During the second quarter of 2018, the SRB is expected to set an MREL
                              requirement for the CA Group at the consolidated level but is not
                              expected to set individual entity MREL levels before 2019.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">TLAC RATIO</h4>
<p>This ratio, the implementation conditions of which were indicated
                              in a Term Sheet published on 9 November 2015, was established by the
                              Financial Stability Board (FSB) at the request of the G20. The FSB
                              defined the calculation of a ratio aimed at estimating the adequacy
                              of the bail-in and recapitalisation capacities of Global Systemically
                              Important banks (G-SIB). This new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
                              ratio, which will be transposed at the European level into the CRR
                              and come into effect from 2019, will provide the resolution authorities
                              with a means to assess whether G-SIBs have sufficient bail-in capacity
                              before and during resolution. As a result, the resolution authorities
                              will be able to implement an ordered resolution strategy that minimises
                              impacts on financial stability, ensures the continuity of the G-SIBs'
                              critical economic functions and limits the use of taxpayers' money.
                              </p>
<p>According to the provisions of the TLAC Term Sheet included in
                              the European Commission's legislative proposal of amendments to the
                              CRR regulation published on 23 November 2016, and currently under
                              review by the European Parliament and Council, the minimum level of
                              the TLAC ratio corresponds to twice the minimum regulatory requirements
                              (i.e. the maximum between 6% of the leverage ratio denominator and
                              16% of the risk-weighted assets, plus applicable regulatory buffers)
                              effective 1 January 2019, and the maximum between 6.75% of the leverage
                              ratio denominator and 18% of the risk-weighted assets (excluding buffers)
                              from 1 January 2022. This minimum level could be increased by the
                              resolution authorities through the MREL requirement (see previous
                              point).
                              </p>
<p>This ratio will apply solely to Global Systemically Important Institutions,
                              and thus to Crédit Agricole Group, starting in 2019. Crédit Agricole
                              CIB will not be subject to this ratio, as it is not classified as
                              a G-SIB by the FSB.
                              </p>
<p>The elements that could absorb losses are made up of equity, subordinated
                              notes and debts to which the resolution authority can apply the bail-in.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole Group must comply with a TLAC ratio over 19.5%
                              (including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a G-SIB buffer
                              of 1%) from 2019 then 21.5% from 2022. Crédit Agricole Group aims
                              to comply with these TLAC requirements excluding eligible preferred
                              senior debt, subject to changes in methods of calculating risk-weighted
                              assets.

<p>As of 31 December 2017, all major risks identified during the risk
                              identification process are taken into account. For each of these risks,
                              measurements of economic capital requirements have been developed,
                              including an adjustment to the requirements of Pillar 1, if necessary.
                              The Group measures in particular: credit risk, interest rate risk
                              on the banking book, issuer risk, business risk and strategic risk,
                              liquidity price risk.

<p>A specific comitology within Crédit Agricole CIB ensures the coherence
                              of all methodologies for measuring economic capital requirements.
                              </p>
<p>The measurement of economic capital is supplemented by a latest
                              estimate for the current year, consistent with forecast capital requirements
                              at the same date, in such a way as to take into account the effects
                              of the principal regulatory reforms that can be foreseen.
                              </p>
<p>In addition to the quantitative aspect, the Group's approach also
                              relies on a qualitative component supplementing the measurement of
                              economic capital requirements with indicators of the business lines'
                              exposure to risk and their permanent controls. The qualitative component

<p>A general overview of credit and counterparty risk is presented

                              (page 230) by type of regulatory method: standard method (page 231)
                              and IRB method (page 233). Counterparty risk is examined on page 244,
                              followed by a section devoted to risk reduction techniques for credit
                              and counterparty risk (page 249).

<p>The following tables hereafter show the Crédit Agricole CIB Group's
                              exposure to credit risk by exposure category for the standard and
                              internal ratings-based approaches. This exposure corresponds to gross
                              exposure (on and off-balance sheet) after netting and before risk
                              mitigation techniques (guarantees and collateral).
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB calculates counterparty risk for all its exposures,
                              whether in the banking book or the trading book. For items in the
                              trading book, counterparty risk is calculated in accordance with the
                              provisions relating to the prudential supervision of market risk.
                              </p>
<p>The regulatory treatment of counterparty risk on forward financial
                              instruments in the banking book is defined for regulatory purposes
                              in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013. Crédit Agricole CIB
                              uses the internal model method (Article 283) to measure its exposure
                              to counterparty risk on forward financial instruments.

                              2017, down 13% compared to 31 December 2016. They represent 1.3% of
                              the total gross exposures compared to 1.5% at the end of 2016. The
                              total amount of provisions/impairments fell by €0.6 billion compared
                              to the end of December 2016, particularly as a result of the reduction
                              in exposures in default.

                              main entities to use the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to calculate
                              their regulatory capital requirements for operational risk. The Group's
                              other entities use the standardised approach, in accordance with regulations.

<p>CA Indosuez Wealth Management is subject to standard calculation
                              methodology in respect of its operational risk only.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with the commitment made by the Group to gradually
                              move toward the advanced method defined with the ACPR in May 2007
                              (roll-out plan), work is ongoing in the main entities and portfolios
                              still under the standard method. An update of the rollout plan is
                              sent annually to the competent authority.
                              </p>
<p>The use of internal models to calculate the solvency ratios has
                              enabled Crédit Agricole CIB Group to strengthen its risk management.
                              Specifically, the development of "internal ratings-based" approaches
                              has led to the systematic and reliable collection of default and loss
                              histories for most Group entities. The establishment of this data
                              history makes it possible to quantify credit risk today by assigning
                              an average Probability of Default (PD) to each rating level, and for
                              the "advanced internal rating" approaches to assign a loss given default
                              (LGD).
                              </p>
<p>In addition, the parameters of the "Internal Ratings-Based" models
                              are used in the definition, implementation and monitoring of the entities'
                              risk and credit policies.
                              </p>
<p>The internal risk assessment models thus promote the development
                              of sound risk management practices by the Group's entities and improve
                              the efficiency of the capital allocation process by enabling a more
                              fine-tuned measurement of capital consumption by each business line
                              and entity.

                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB, like its parent, addresses counterparty risks
                              for all of its exposures, whether these depend on the banking portfolio
                              or the trading book (portfolio). For items in the trading book, counterparty
                              risk is calculated in accordance with the provisions relating to the
                              regulatory supervision of market risk.
                              </p>
<p>The regulatory treatment of counterparty risk on transactions on
                              forward financial instruments in the banking portfolio is defined
                              on a regulatory basis in Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of 26 June 2013.
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. Group uses the market price method to measure
                              its exposure to counterparty risk on transactions on forward financial
                              instruments in the banking portfolio (Article 274) or the internal
                              model method (Article 283) within the scope of Crédit Agricole CIB.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ CVA</h4>
<p>CRD 4 introduced a new capital charge to reflect Credit Valuation
                              Adjustment (CVA) volatility, a valuation adjustment on assets known
                              as CVA Risk, whose purpose is to recognise credit events affecting
                              our counterparties in the valuation of OTC derivatives. As such, CVA
                              is defined as the difference between the valuation without default
                              risk and the valuation that takes into account the probability of
                              default of our counterparties. Under this directive, institutions
                              use a supervisory formula ("standard method") or calculate their capital
                              requirements using the internal model for counterparty risk and the
                              advanced approach ("CVA VaR") for specific interest rate risk. The
                              CVA requirement under the advanced approach is calculated on the basis
                              of anticipated positive exposures on OTC derivatives transactions
                              vis-à-vis "Financial institutions" counterparties excluding intragroup
                              transactions. Under this scope, the system used to estimate the capital
                              requirements is the same as the one used to calculate the market VaR
                              for the specific interest rate risk.

                              RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">COLLATERAL
                              MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
                              </h4>
<p>The main categories of collateral taken by the Bank are described
                              under "Risk Factors - Credit Risk - Collateral and Guarantees Received",
                              page 174.
                              </p>
<p>When a credit is granted, collateral is analysed specifically to
                              assess the value of the asset, its liquidity, volatility and the correlation
                              between the value of the collateral and the quality of the counterparty
                              financed. Regardless of collateral quality, the first criterion in
                              the lending decision is always the borrower's ability to repay sums
                              due from cash flow generated by its operating activities, except for
                              specific trade finance transactions.
                              </p>
<p>For financial collateral, a minimum exposure coverage ratio is
                              usually included in loan contracts, with readjustment clauses. Financial
                              collateral is revalued according to the frequency of margin calls
                              and the variability of the underlying value of the financial assets
                              transferred as collateral or quarterly, as a minimum.
                              </p>
<p>The minimum coverage ratio (or the haircut applied to the value
                              of the collateral under Basel II) is determined by measuring the pseudo-maximum
                              deviation of the value of the securities on the revaluation date.
                              This measurement is calculated with a 99% confidence interval over
                              a time horizon covering the period between each revaluation, the period
                              between the default date and the date on which asset liquidation starts,
                              and the duration of the liquidation period. This haircut also applies
                              for currency mismatch risk when the securities and the collateralised
                              exposure are denominated in different currencies. Additional haircuts
                              are applied when the size of the stock position necessitates a block
                              sale or when the borrower and the issuer of the collateral securities
                              belong to the same risk group.
                              </p>
<p>Other types of asset may also be pledged as non recourse financial
                              assets. This is notably the case for certain activities such as asset
                              financing for aircrafts, shipping, real estate or commodities.

<p>In addition to the use of credit derivatives (see "Risk factors
                              and Pillar 3", section Credit risks - Use of credit derivatives),
                              this activity consists of using securitisation to manage the credit
                              risk in the corporate financing portfolio, optimising the allocation
                              of equity, reducing the concentration of outstanding loans to corporates,
                              freeing up resources to contribute to the renewal of the banking portfolio
                              (in the framework of the Distribute to Originate model) and optimising
                              the profitability of shareholders' funds. This activity is managed
                              by the ALM/CPM Execution teams. The supervisory formula approach is
                              used to calculate the weighted exposures on proprietary securitisations.
                              In this activity, the Bank does not systematically purchase insurance
                              on all tranches, as the management goal is to cover some of the most
                              risky financing portfolio tranches whilst keeping part of the overall
                              risk.

                              strategy deployed by Crédit Agricole CIB. A second synthetic securitisation

                              December 2017. This transaction, called VIADUC and concluded with
                              the BEI Group, also makes it possible to provide an enhanced envelope
                              for the benefit of the Caisses Régionales for the ultimate benefit

<p>Risk management related to securitisation transactions follows
                              the rules established by the Group and depends on whether the assets
                              are recognised in the banking book (credit and counterparty risk)
                              or trading book (market and counterparty risk).
                              </p>
<p>The development, scaling and targeting of securitisation transactions
                              are periodically reviewed by Portfolio Strategy Committees specific
                              to those activities and the respective countries, as well as by the
                              Group Risks Committees.
                              </p>
<p>Risks on securitisation transactions are measured against the capacity
                              of the assets transferred to financing vehicles to generate sufficient
                              flows to cover the costs, mainly financial, of these vehicles.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's securitisation exposures are treated using
                              the IRB-securitisation approach, i.e.:

<p>As regards the stress simulation parameters, these depend on the
                              rating of the securitisations and securitised underlyings. For example,

                              of several elements including a degradation of three ratings on the

                              </p>
<p>It should be noted that beyond the needs of prudential calculations,
                              the internal ratings are used as part of the origination process to
                              assess the profitability of transactions.

<p>At 31 December 2017, among the securitised assets, only Ester Finance
                              Titrisation recognized impaired receivables of €143.7 million and
                              related impairments of €31.6 million. Net of impairments, the total
                              amount of securitised assets within this entity was €13.5 billion.

<p>The liquidity risk associated with securitisation activities is
                              monitored by the business lines in charge, but also centrally by the
                              Market Risk and Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Departments.
                              The impact of these activities is incorporated into the Internal Liquidity
                              Model indicators - mainly the stress scenarios, liquidity ratios and
                              liquidity gaps. The management of liquidity risk at Crédit Agricole
                              CIB is described in more detail in the paragraph "Liquidity and financing

<p>The management of structural foreign exchange risk with respect
                              to securitisation activities does not differ from that of the Group's
                              other assets. As regards interest rate risk management, securitised
                              assets are refinanced through special purpose vehicles according to
                              rules for matching interest rates closely to those of the other assets.
                              </p>
<p>For assets of discontinuing activities, each transfer of position
                              is first approved by Crédit Agricole CIB's Market Risk Department.

                              to be recognised according to their original classification and valuation
                              method (see Note 1.3 on Accounting policies and principles of the
                              consolidated financial statements for the classification and valuation
                              of financial assets).
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, investments in securitisation instruments (cash or synthetic)
                              are recognised on the basis of their classification and their associated
                              valuation (see Note 1.3 on Accounting policies and principles of the
                              consolidated financial statements for the classification and valuation

<p>Securitisation positions can be classified into the following accounting

<p>IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers" will become effective
                              for years beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (in accordance with
                              EU Regulation No. 2016/1905). The "Clarification of IFRS 15" amendment,
                              which provides additional details, enters into force on the same date
                              (in accordance with EU Regulation No. 2017/1987).
                              </p>
<p>For the first-time application of this standard, Crédit Agricole
                              Group elected to apply the modified retrospective method, recognising
                              the cumulative effect as of 1 January 2018, with no comparison for
                              2017, with any impact the standard has on the various items in the
                              financial statements being detailed in the notes.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 15 will replace IAS 11 "Construction contracts" and IAS 18
                              "Revenue", along with all the related interpretations relating to
                              IFRIC 13 "Customer loyalty programs", IFRIC 15 "Agreements for the
                              construction of real estate", IFRIC 18 "Transfers of assets from customers"
                              and SIC 31 "Revenue - barter transactions involving advertising services".
                              </p>
<p>It consolidates in a single text the principles for recognising
                              revenue from long-term sales contracts, sales of goods and the provision
                              of services that do not fall within the scope of the standards for
                              financial Instruments (IAS 39/IFRS 9), insurance contracts (IFRS 4/IFRS

                              </h4>
<p>Under IFRS 9, the classification and measurement criteria depend
                              on the nature of the financial asset, namely whether it qualifies
                              as a debt instrument (i.e. loan, advance, credit, bond, fund unit)
                              or an equity instrument (i.e. share).
                              </p>
<p>In the case of debt instruments (loans and fixed or determinable
                              income securities), IFRS 9 tests the business model and contractual
                              terms to classify and measure the financial assets.
                              </p>
<p>The three business models:</p>

                              both the sale of financial assets and the collection of the cash flows
                              are essential; and

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">The contractual
                              terms (the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest [SPPI] test):
                              </h4>
<p>This second criterion is applied to the contractual terms of the
                              loan or debt security to finally determine the accounting classification
                              and measurement category to which the instrument belongs. When the
                              debt instrument has expected cash flows that are not solely payments
                              of principal and interest (i.e. simple rate), its contractual terms
                              are deemed too complex and, as a result, the loan or debt security
                              is recognised at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the
                              business model. This involves the instruments that do not satisfy
                              the conditions of the SPPI test.
                              </p>
<p>Contractual characteristics (or SPPI) testing combines a set of
                              criteria, examined cumulatively, to establish whether contractual
                              cash flows meet the characteristics of simple financing (principal
                              repayments and interest payments on the remaining amount of principal
                              due).
                              </p>
<p>In simple financing, interest represents the cost of the passage
                              of time, the price of credit and liquidity risk over the period, and
                              other components related to the cost of carrying the asset (e.g. administrative
                              costs).
                              </p>
<p>In some cases, when qualitative analysis of this nature does not
                              allow a conclusion to be made, quantitative analysis (or benchmark
                              testing) is carried out. This additional analysis consists of comparing
                              the contractual cash flows of the asset under review with the cash
                              flows of a benchmark asset.
                              </p>
<p>If the difference between the cash flows of the financial asset
                              and the benchmark asset is considered immaterial, the asset is deemed
                              to be simple financing.
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, specific analysis is conducted when the financial asset
                              is issued by special purpose entities establishing a differentiated
                              order of payment among the holders of the financial assets by contractually
                              linking multiple instruments and creating concentrations of credit
                              risk ("tranches").
                              </p>
<p>Each tranche is assigned a rank of subordination that specifies
                              the order of distribution of cash flows generated by the structured
                              entity.
                              </p>
<p>In this case, the SPPI test requires an analysis of the characteristics
                              of the contractual cash flows of the underlying assets and the credit
                              risk borne by the tranches subscribed under the "look-through" approach.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">IMPAIRMENT</h4>
<p>IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model that requires the recognition
                              of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on loans and debt instruments measured
                              at amortised cost or fair value in other comprehensive income (recyclable),
                              on loan commitments and on financial guarantee contracts that are
                              not recognised at fair value, as well as receivables from leases and
                              trade receivables.
                              </p>
<p>This new ECL approach is designed to bring forward as much as possible
                              the recognition of expected credit losses, whereas under the IAS 39
                              provisioning model, it is subject to there being objective evidence
                              that an impairment loss has been incurred.
                              </p>
<p>ECL is defined as the weighted expected probable value of the discounted
                              credit loss (principal and interest). It represents the present value
                              of the difference between the contractual cash flows and the expected
                              cash flows (including principal and interest).
                              </p>
<p>The formula includes the probability of default, loss given default
                              and exposure at default parameters.
                              </p>
<p>These calculations are broadly based on the internal models used
                              as part of the regulatory framework, but with adjustments to determine
                              an economic ECL.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 9 recommends a Point in Time analysis while considering historical
                              loss data and forward looking macro-economic data, whereas the regulatory
                              perspective is analysed Through the Cycle for probability of default
                              and in a downturn for loss given default.
                              </p>
<p>The accounting approach also requires the recalculation of certain
                              Basel parameters, in particular to eliminate the internal recovery
                              costs or floors that are imposed by the regulator in the regulatory
                              calculation of Loss Given Default (LGD).
                              </p>
<p>The new credit risk provisioning model has three stages:</p>
<table cellpadding="0mm" class="list_table_ul">
<tr>
<td class="list_ident">―</td>
<td class="list_content">
<p class="list_p_fl">first stage: upon the initial recognition of the financial

                              recognises the expected losses over the full lifetime;

                              incurred credit losses at maturity.

</table>
<p>At the second stage, the monitoring and estimation of the significant
                              deterioration in credit risk can be done on a transaction-by-transaction
                              basis or collectively at portfolio level by grouping instruments on
                              the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. The approach calls
                              on a wide range of information, including historical data on observed
                              losses, cyclical and structural adjustments, and loss projections
                              based on reasonable scenarios.
                              </p>
<p>This deterioration depends on the risk level on the date of initial
                              recognition and must be recognised before the transaction is impaired
                              (third stage).

                              </h4>
<p>IFRS 9 allows the early adoption of requirements relating to specific
                              credit risk relating to financial liabilities designated as at fair
                              value through profit or loss, namely the recognition of changes in
                              value attributable to specific credit risk in other comprehensive
                              income (non-recyclable). In accordance with the Group's guidelines,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB has decided against early adoption of these requirements.
                              Further, IASB has clarified the accounting treatment of a non-substantial
                              change in the contractual terms of a debt that does not result in
                              its derecognition. The impact of the change is recognised immediately

<p>The main change made by IFRS 16 relates to accounting for lessees.
                              IFRS 16 will call for a model in respect of lessees that recognises

                              </h4>
<p>Financial assets and liabilities are treated in the financial statements
                              in accordance with IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Commission.
                              </p>
<p>At the time of initial recognition, financial assets and financial
                              liabilities are measured at fair value including trading costs (with
                              the exception of financial instruments recognised at fair value through
                              profit or loss). After the initial recognition, financial assets and
                              financial liabilities are measured according to their classification,
                              either at fair value or at amortised cost based on the effective interest
                              rate method.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received
                              to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction
                              between market participants, on the principal or the most advantageous
                              market, at the measurement date.
                              </p>
<p>The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
                              estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life
                              of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period,
                              to obtain the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial
                              liability.

<p>According to IAS 39, this portfolio comprises securities that are
                              classified under financial assets at fair value through profit or
                              loss either as a result of a genuine intention to trade them financial
                              assets held for trading) or of being designated at fair value by Crédit
                              Agricole CIB.
                              </p>
<p>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are assets
                              acquired or generated by the company primarily with the aim of disposal
                              in the short term or which are included in a portfolio of financial
                              instruments managed as a unit and with the purpose of making a profit
                              from short-term price fluctuations or an arbitrage margin.
                              </p>
<p>Financial assets may be recognised at fair value through profit
                              or loss designated as held-for-trading, provided that they meet the
                              conditions defined in the standard, in the following three scenarios:
                              for hybrid instruments comprising one or more embedded derivatives,
                              with a view to reducing the distortion of accounting treatment or
                              in the case of a group of managed financial assets whose performance
                              is measured at fair value. This method is generally used so that derivatives
                              embedded in hybrid instruments do not have to be recognised and measured
                              separately.
                              </p>
<p>Securities that are classified under financial assets at fair value
                              through profit or loss are recognised at fair value at inception,
                              excluding transaction costs attributable directly to their acquisition
                              (which are taken directly to profit or loss).
                              </p>
<p>They are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair
                              value are recognised in profit and loss, under the heading
                              </p>
<p>"Net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value through
                              profit and loss".
                              </p>
<p>No impairment losses are booked for this category of securities.</p>
<p>Outstanding syndication securities held for sale are recognised
                              as Financial assets held for trading and are measured at fair value.

<p>The loans and receivables comprise unlisted financial assets that
                              generate fixed or determinable payments.
                              </p>
<p>The securities of the loans and receivables portfolio are initially
                              recognised at acquisition cost, including transaction costs that are
                              directly attributable to the acquisition and including accrued interest.
                              </p>
<p>They are subsequently measured at amortised cost with amortisation
                              of any premium or discount and transaction costs using the effective
                              interest method.

<p>IAS 39 defines "Available-for-sale financial assets" both as assets
                              that are designated as available-for-sale and as the default category.
                              </p>
<p>Securities designated as "Available-for-sale financial assets"
                              are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs that
                              are directly attributable to the acquisition and including accrued
                              interest.
                              </p>
<p>"Available-for-sale financial assets" are later measured at fair
                              value and subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive
                              income.
                              </p>

<p>Amortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs
                              on fixed-income securities is recognised in the income statement using
                              the effective interest rate method.

<p>Impairment shall be booked when there is objective evidence of
                              impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the
                              initial recognition of the securities, other than assets measured
                              as at fair value through profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Objective evidence of loss corresponds to a prolonged or significant
                              decline in the value of the security for equity securities or the
                              appearance of significant deterioration in credit risk evidenced by
                              a risk of non-recovery for debt securities.
                              </p>
<p>For equity securities, Crédit Agricole CIB uses quantitative criteria
                              as indicators of potential impairment. These quantitative criteria
                              are mainly based on a loss of 30% or more of the value of the equity
                              instrument over a period of six consecutive months. Crédit Agricole
                              CIB may also take account of other factors such as financial difficulties
                              of the issuer, short-term prospects, etc.
                              </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above-mentioned criteria, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              recognises an impairment loss when the decline in the value of the
                              equity instrument exceeds 50% or lasts for over three years.
                              </p>
<p>For debt securities, impairment criteria are the same as for loans
                              and receivables.
                              </p>
<p>Such impairment is only recognised when it translates into a probable
                              loss of all or part of the amount invested:

<p>Loans are principally allocated to the Loans and receivables category.
                              In accordance with IAS 39, they are initially valued at fair value
                              and subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest
                              rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly
                              discounts estimated future cash payments to the original net loan
                              amount. This rate includes the discounts and any transaction income
                              or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
                              </p>
<p>Syndication loans held for trading are classified as "Financial
                              assets held for trading" and are measured at fair value.

<p>Impairment losses are discounted and estimated on the basis of

                              from current estimates, which may lead to an increase or decrease
                              in the amount of the impairment.

<p>Statistical and historical customer default experience shows that

                              impairment losses, calculated using models developed on the basis
                              of these statistical data, by way of deduction from asset values.

<p>With regard to the Basel rules, Crédit Agricole CIB determines,
                              through statistical basis and tools, the amount of the foreseeable
                              losses over the current year, according to multiple observable data
                              that match the loss events as defined in IAS 39.
                              </p>
<p>The amount of impairment is based on the probability of default
                              in each rating class assigned to borrowers, and also on Risk Management's
                              experienced judgement.
                              </p>

                              such as sector or country impairment losses. These provisions are
                              intended to cover estimated risks based on a sector or geographical

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">LOAN RESTRUCTURING</h4>
<p>Loans restructured due to financial difficulties are loans for
                              which the entity changed the initial financial terms (interest rate,
                              term) for economic or legal reasons connected with the borrower's
                              financial difficulties, in a manner that would not have been considered
                              under other circumstances. Thus, they consist of loans classified
                              as in default and performing loans at the date they are restructured.
                              </p>
<p>The reduction of future flows granted to a counterparty, which
                              may notably stem from these flows being postponed as part of the restructuring,
                              results in the recognition of a discount. It represents future loss
                              of cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate.

                              OF THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS_
                              </h4>
<p>The fair value of financial instruments is measured by maximising
                              the use of observable input data. It is presented following the hierarchy
                              defined in IFRS 13.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received
                              to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction
                              between market participants, on the principal or the most advantageous
                              market, at the measurement date.
                              </p>
<p>The fair value applies separately to each financial asset and each
                              financial liability. A portfolio exemption may be used where the management
                              and risk monitoring strategy so allow and are appropriately documented.
                              Hence, when a group of financial assets and liabilities are managed
                              on a net exposure basis to market and credit risks, some parameters
                              of the fair value are calculated on a net basis. This is the case
                              for the calculation of CVA, DVA and FVA.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB considers that the best evidence of fair value
                              is quoted prices published in an active market. When such quoted prices
                              are not available, the fair value is established by using a valuation
                              technique based on observable data or unobservable inputs.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB incorporates into the fair value the assessment
                              of counterparty risk for derivative assets (Credit Valuation Adjustment
                              - CVA) and, using a symmetrical treatment, the non-performance risk
                              for derivative liabilities (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA or own
                              credit risk).
                              </p>
<p>The CVA makes it possible to determine the expected losses due
                              to the counterparty from the perspective of Crédit Agricole CIB Group,
                              and DVA the expected losses due to Crédit Agricole CIB Group from
                              the perspective of the counterparty.
                              </p>
<p>The CVA/DVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected
                              losses based on the probability of default and loss given default.
                              The methodology used maximises the use of observable market inputs.
                              It is primarily based on market data such as registered and listed
                              CDS (or Single Name CDS) or CDS proxy.

                              This adjustment is measured based on positive or negative future exposure
                              of transactions for which a cost of financing is applied.

                              to shares and bonds listed in an active market (such as the Paris
                              Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange,
                              etc.), units of investment funds listed in active markets and derivatives
                              contracted in a organised market, especially futures contracts.

<p>A market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily
                              and regularly available from an exchange, broker, dealer, pricing
                              service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and
                              regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

<p>When current prices of financial instruments are unavailable at
                              the reporting date, Crédit Agricole CIB refers to the price of the

<p>For financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB uses mid-prices as a basis for establishing fair
                              values for the offsetting risk positions. The Group applies the current
                              bid price to asset held or liability to be issued (open long position)
                              and the current asking price to asset to be acquired or liability

                              </h4>
<p>For some complex instruments that are not traded in an active market,
                              fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques using assumptions
                              i.e. that cannot be observed on the market for an identical instrument.
                              These instruments are disclosed within level 3.
                              </p>
<p>This mainly concerns complex interest rate instruments, equity
                              derivatives, structured credit instruments which fair value measurement
                              includes for instance correlation or volatility inputs that are not
                              directly benchmarkable.
                              </p>
<p>Since the transaction price is deemed to reflect the fair value
                              at initial recognition, any day one gain or loss recognition is deferred.
                              </p>
<p>The margin earned on these structured financial instruments is
                              generally recognised in profit or loss by spreading over the duration
                              during which the parameters are considered unobservable. When market
                              data become "observable", the remaining margin to be deferred is immediately
                              recognised in profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Valuation methodologies and models used for financial instruments
                              that are disclosed within levels 2 and 3 incorporate all factors that
                              market participants would consider in setting a price. They must be
                              validated beforehand by an independent control. Fair value measurement
                              notably includes both liquidity risk and counterparty risk.

<p>In accordance with the principles of IAS 39, if the various techniques

<p>At each reporting date, Crédit Agricole CIB Group sets aside reserves
                              to cover its liabilities for retirement and similar benefits and all
                              other employee benefits falling in the category of defined-benefit
                              plans.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 19, these commitments are stated based on
                              a set of actuarial, financial and demographic assumptions, and in
                              accordance with the projected unit credit method. This method consists
                              in booking a charge for each period of service, for an amount corresponding
                              to employee's vested benefits for the period. This charge is calculated
                              based on the discounted future benefit.
                              </p>
<p>The calculations pertaining to the liabilities for retirement and
                              other employee benefits are based on assumptions made by management
                              with respect to the discount rate, staff turnover rate and probable
                              increases in salary and social security costs. If the actual figures
                              differ from the assumptions made,
                              </p>
<p>the retirement liability may increase or decrease in future years
                              (see Note 7.4 "Post-employment benefits, defined-benefit plans").
                              </p>
<p>The discount rates are determined based on the average term of
                              the commitment, that is, the arithmetical average of the terms calculated
                              between the valuation date and the payment date weighted by employee
                              turnover assumptions.
                              </p>
<p>The anticipated return on plan assets is also estimated by management.
                              The returns are estimated on the basis of expected returns on fixed
                              income securities, and notably bonds.
                              </p>
<p>The expected return on plan assets is determined using discount
                              rates applied to measure the defined benefit obligation.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 19 revised, Crédit Agricole CIB recognises
                              all actuarial gains or losses in other comprehensive income.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is 99.9% owned by Crédit Agricole Group since
                              27 December 1996 and some of its subsidiaries are part of the tax
                              consolidation Group of Crédit Agricole S.A..
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 12, the income tax charge includes all income
                              taxes, whether current or deferred.
                              </p>
<p>The standard defines current tax liability as "the amount of income
                              tax payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss)
                              for a reporting period". Taxable income is the profit (or loss) for
                              a given accounting period measured in accordance with the rules determined
                              by the taxation authorities.
                              </p>
<p>The applicable rates and rules used to measure the current tax
                              liability are those in effect in each country where the Group's companies
                              are established.
                              </p>
<p>The current tax liability relates to any income due or that will
                              become due, for which payment is not subordinated to the completion
                              of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several years.
                              </p>
<p>The current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until
                              it is paid. If the amount that has already been paid for the current
                              year and previous years exceeds the amount due for these years, the
                              surplus must be recognised under assets.
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, certain transactions carried out by the entity may have
                              tax consequences that are not taken into account in measuring the
                              current tax liability. IAS 12 defines the difference between the carrying
                              amount of an asset or liability and its tax basis as a temporary difference.
                              </p>

                              Accordingly, unrealised gains recognised at the end of the year generate

                              a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
                              </p>
<p>For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be
                              available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale
                              must be highly probable.
                              </p>
<p>The relevant assets and liabilities are shown separately on the
                              balance sheet under Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued
                              operations and Liabilities associated with non-current assets held-for-sale
                              and discontinued operations.
                              </p>
<p>A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for
                              sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value
                              less costs of sale. A charge for impairment of unrealised gains is
                              recognised in the income statement. Unrealised gains are no longer
                              amortised when they are reclassified.
                              </p>
<p>If the fair value of a disposal group less selling costs is under
                              its carrying amount after impairment of non-current assets, the difference
                              is allocated to other disposal group assets including the financial
                              assets and is recognised under net income of held-for-sale operations.
                              </p>

                              disposed of, or is classified as held-for-sale, according to the following

                              </h4>
<p>In compliance with international accounting standards, all entities
                              under control, under joint control or under significant influence
                              are consolidated, provided that they are not covered by the exclusions
                              below.
                              </p>
<p>Exclusive control over an entity is deemed to exist if Crédit Agricole
                              CIB is exposed to or entitled to receive variable returns as a result
                              of its involvement with the entity and if the power it holds over
                              this entity allows it to influence these returns. Power in this context
                              means substantive (voting or contractual) rights. Rights are considered
                              substantive if the holder of the rights can in practice exercise them
                              when decisions about the company's relevant activities are made.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is deemed to control a subsidiary through voting
                              rights when its rights give it the practical ability to direct the
                              subsidiary's relevant activities. Crédit Agricole CIB generally controls
                              the subsidiary when it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries,
                              more than half of the existing or potential voting rights of an entity,
                              unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such holding does not allow
                              directing relevant activities. Control is also deemed to exist where
                              Crédit Agricole CIB holds half or less than half of the voting rights,
                              including potential rights, in an entity but is able in practice to
                              direct its relevant activities at its sole discretion, notably because
                              of the existence of contractual arrangements, the size of its stake
                              in the voting rights compared to those of other investors, or other
                              reasons.
                              </p>
<p>Control of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of
                              voting rights as these have no effect on the entity's returns. When
                              assessing control, consideration is given not only to contractual
                              arrangements in force but also to whether Crédit Agricole CIB was
                              involved in creating the entity and what decisions it made at the
                              time, what agreements were made at its inception and what risks are
                              borne by Crédit Agricole CIB, any rights under agreements that give
                              the investor the power to direct relevant activities in specific circumstances
                              only and any other facts or circumstances that indicate the investor
                              can direct the entity's relevant activities. Where a management mandate
                              exists, the scope of the decision-making authority relating to the
                              delegation of power to the manager and the remuneration to which the
                              contractual arrangements entitles are analysed in order to determine
                              whether the manager acts as an agent (delegated power) or principal
                              (for his own account).
                              </p>
<p>Thus, when decisions about the relevant activities of the entity
                              need to be taken, the indicators to be analysed in order to define
                              whether an entity acts as an agent or as the principal are the scope
                              of the decision-making power delegated to the manager over the entity,
                              the remunerations to which the contractual arrangements give entitlement,
                              but also the substantive rights that may affect the decision-maker's
                              capacity held by the other parties involved in the entity, and the
                              exposure to the entity and the variability in returns from other interests
                              held in the entity.
                              </p>
<p>Joint control is deemed to exist when there is a contractual division
                              of control over an economic activity. Decisions affecting the entity's
                              relevant activities require unanimous agreement of the joint controllers.
                              </p>
<p>In traditional entities, significant influence is defined as the
                              power to influence but not control a company's financial and operational
                              policies. Crédit Agricole CIB is presumed to have significant influence
                              if it owns 20% or more of the voting rights in an entity, whether
                              directly or indirectly through subsidiaries.

                              amount using the pooling of interests method, with reference to US
                              standard ASU805-50 which seems to comply with the IFRS general principles.

<p>On the date of acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities
                              and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity which satisfy the
                              conditions for recognition set out in IFRS 3 are recognised at their
                              fair value.
                              </p>
<p>Notably, restructuring liabilities are only recognised as a liability
                              of the acquired entity if, at the date of acquisition, the acquiree
                              is under an obligation to complete the restructuring.
                              </p>
<p>Price adjustment clauses are recognised at fair value even if their
                              application is not probable. Subsequent changes in the fair value
                              of clauses if they are financial liabilities are recognised in the
                              income statement. Only price adjustment clauses relating to transactions
                              where control was obtained at the latest by 31 December 2009 may still
                              be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were accounted
                              for under IFRS 3 pre-revision (2004).

<p>The consideration transferred on the occasion of a business combination
                              (the acquisition costs) is valued as the total of the fair values
                              transferred by the acquirer at the date of acquisition in exchange
                              for control of the acquired entity (e.g. cash flow, equity instruments).
                              </p>
<p>The costs directly attributable to the business combination are
                              recognised as expenses, separately from the business combination.
                              If the transaction has very strong possibilities of occurring, they
                              are recognised under the heading "Net gains (losses) on disposal of
                              other assets", otherwise they are recognised under the heading "Operating
                              expenses".

<p>The difference between the cost of acquisition and interests that
                              do not allow control and the net balance on the date of acquisition
                              of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities taken over, valued
                              at their fair value is recognised, when it is positive, in the assets
                              side of the consolidated balance sheet, under the heading "Goodwill"
                              when the acquired entity is fully consolidated and in the heading
                              "Investments in equity-accounted entities" when the acquired company
                              is consolidated using the equity method of accounting. Any negative
                              goodwill is recognised immediately through profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at its initial amount
                              in the currency of the acquired entity and translated at the closing
                              rate at the end of the reporting period.
                              </p>
<p>When control is taken by stages, the interest held before taking
                              control is revalued at fair value through profit or loss at the date
                              of acquisition and the goodwill is calculated once, using the fair
                              value at the date of acquisition of acquired assets and liabilities
                              taken over.
                              </p>
<p>Goodwill is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence
                              of a loss of value and at least once a year.
                              </p>
<p>The choices and assumptions used in assessing the holdings that
                              do not allow control at the date of acquisition may influence the
                              amount of initial goodwill and any impairment resulting from a loss
                              of value.
                              </p>
<p>For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to
                              the Group Cash Generating Units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit
                              from the business combination. The CGUs have been defined within the
                              Group's business lines as the smallest identifiable group of assets
                              and liabilities functioning in a single business model. Impairment
                              testing consists of comparing the carrying amount of each CGU, including
                              any goodwill allocated to it, with its recoverable amount.
                              </p>
<p>The recoverable amount of the CGU is defined as the higher of fair
                              value diminished of selling costs and value in use. The value in use
                              is the present value of the future cash flows of the CGU, as set out
                              in medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for management
                              purposes.
                              </p>
<p>When the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount,
                              a corresponding impairment loss is recognised for the goodwill allocated
                              to the CGU. This impairment is irreversible.
                              </p>
<p>In the case of an increase in the interest percentage of Crédit

                              is recorded in the heading "Consolidated reserves -Group share". In

                              of IAS 32, means that the minority interests are treated as a liability

                              </h4>
<p>The Finance Act for 2018 includes in Article 219-1 of the French
                              General Tax Code a gradual lowering of the corporate income tax rate
                              with the aim of bringing it down gradually to 25% in 2022 for all
                              companies. For the financial years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the
                              maximum normal rate, including a social security tax of 3.3%, will
                              been reduced to 32.023%, 28.92%, 27.37% and 25.83%.

<p>As a result, the deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December
                              2017 were measured at the amount that is expected to be paid to or
                              received from the tax authorities having regard to the dates of repayment
                              or the recoverability of the deferred tax bases.

                              </h4>
<p>The US tax reform law was signed in 22 December 2017 by President
                              Trump and has therefore been adopted definitively. Among other things,
                              this reform lowers the income tax rate for US corporations from 35%
                              to 21% for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2018.
                              </p>
<p>This reduction in the income tax rate has an immediate effect on
                              the deferred taxes of the Group's US subsidiaries, mainly in the Large
                              Customers and Corporate and Investment Banking business lines.

<p>Factoring in the future reductions in the corporate income tax
                              in regard to the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the CACIB
                              Group's North American companies, these reductions had an impact of
                              €70.5 million in 2017.

<p>On 20 September 2017, of the 31.1% of Banque Saudi Fransi securities
                              held, CACIB sold 16.2% to Kingdom Holding Company (KHC) for the amount
                              of €1.3 billion. This disposal entails a notable loss of influence,
                              and the securities retained were revalued at their fair value under
                              the classification as available-for-sale securities.
                              </p>
<p>The impact of this sale and of the revaluation of the securities
                              retained, net of the Saudi and French taxes associated with them,
                              amounted to €102 million booked as a portion of net income for the

<p>A fair value hedge modifies the risk caused by changes in the fair

                              in interest rates. Fair value hedges transform fixed-rate assets or

                              </p>
<p>The fair value hedges concern principally fixed-rate loans, securities,

                              Crédit Agricole CIB challenged the proposed adjustments. At the same

                              French-British authorities for all years. A provision was recognised
                              to cover the estimated risk.

                              subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement
                              took place between 2003 and 2008.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and Crédit Agricole S.A., which cooperated
                              with the US and New York authorities in connection with their investigations,
                              have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e.
                              €692.7 million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to
                              the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore,
                              has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.

                              of the Treasury is with Crédit Agricole CIB. Crédit Agricole CIB also
                              entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with
                              the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO)

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A.,

                              as part of investigations into: (i) the calculation of the Libor (London
                              Interbank Offered Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro
                              Interbank Offered Rate) and certain other market indices; and (ii)
                              transactions connected with these rates and indices. These demands
                              covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its cooperation with the authorities, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out investigations
                              in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities
                              and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of
                              Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with which
                              they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the
                              outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Crédit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation
                              opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the
                              Libor and the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>Following its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure,
                              on 21 May 2014, the European Commission sent a notification of grievances
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A. and to Crédit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements
                              or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing,
                              restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the
                              Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>In a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly
                              fined Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB €114,654,000 for
                              participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are challenging this decision
                              and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn it.
                              </p>
<p>Additionally, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, is conducting
                              an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including

                              and international banks. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition
                              authority (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September
                              2015 into Crédit Agricole CIB and the Libor index on various currencies,
                              Euribor and Tibor indices. The KFTC investigation into certain foreign
                              exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) is ongoing.

<p>Concerning the two class actions in the United States of America
                              in which Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have been named
                              since 2012 and 2013 along with other financial institutions, both
                              as defendants in one ("Sullivan" for the Euribor) and only Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ("Lieberman" for Libor),
                              the "Lieberman" class action is at the preliminary stage that consists
                              in the examination of its admissibility; proceedings are still suspended
                              before the US District Court of New York State. Concerning the"Sullivan"
                              class action, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB introduced
                              a motion to dismiss the applicants' claim. The US District Court of
                              New York State upheld the motion to dismiss regarding Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB in first instance. This decision is subject
                              to appeal.
                              </p>
<p>Since 1 July 2016, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB,
                              together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit
                              in the United States ("Frontpoint") relating to the SIBOR (Singapore
                              Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indices.
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to
                              dismiss. The New York Federal Court, ruling in first instance, granted
                              this request last August 18th, in favor of Crédit Agricole S.A. and
                              Crédit Agricole CIB. Following federal procedure which allows them
                              to do so, the plaintiffs modified the terms of their action to refer
                              the case to the judge again. As a consequence, Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and Crédit Agricole CIB have submitted a new motion to dismiss, which
                              must be examined by the New York Federal Court soon.
                              </p>
<p>These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim
                              that they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor,
                              SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek repayment of the sums they allege were
                              unlawfully received, as well as damages and reimbursement of costs
                              and fees paid.

                              actions filed in Canada, one before the Ontario Superior Court of
                              Justice and the other before the Federal Court. Through the cooperation
                              with these regulators, Crédit Agricole CIB proceeded to internal inquiries
                              to gather the required information. It is not possible at this stage
                              to predict the outcome of these investigations or class actions or

<p>There are various mandatory pension plans to which employers contribute.
                              The funds are managed by independent organisations and the contributing
                              companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions
                              if the funds do not have sufficient assets to provide all the benefits
                              corresponding to the services rendered by staff during the current
                              and previous years. As a consequence, Crédit Agricole CIB has no liability
                              in this respect other than the contributions to be paid.
                              </p>
<p>Within Crédit Agricole CIB, there are several compulsory defined-contribution

                              VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
                              </h4>
<p>Fair value is the price that would be received at the sale of an
                              asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm's length transaction
                              between market participants at the valuation date.
                              </p>
<p>Fair value is defined on the basis of an exit price.</p>
<p>The fair values shown below are estimates made on the reporting
                              date using observable market data wherever possible. These are subject
                              to change in subsequent periods due to developments in market conditions
                              or other factors.
                              </p>
<p>The calculations represent best estimates. They are based on a
                              number of assumptions. It is assumed that market participants act
                              in their best economic interest.
                              </p>
<p>To the extent that these models contain uncertainties, the fair
                              values shown may not be achieved upon actual sale or immediate settlement
                              of the financial instruments concerned.
                              </p>
<p>The fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities is
                              broken down according to the general observability criteria of the
                              valuation inputs, pursuant to the principles defined under IFRS 13.
                              </p>
<p>Level 1 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
                              quoted in active markets.
                              </p>
<p>Level 2 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
                              with observable inputs.
                              </p>
<p>This includes, in particular, market data relating to interest
                              rate risk or credit risk when the latter can be revalued based on
                              Credit Default Swap (CDS) prices. Repurchase agreements with underlyings
                              quoted in an active market are also included in level 2 of the hierarchy,
                              as are financial assets with a demand component for which fair value
                              is measured at unadjusted amortised cost.
                              </p>
<p>Level 3 indicates the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
                              with unobservable inputs or for which some data can be revalued using
                              internal models based on historical data. This includes, in particular,
                              market data relating to credit risk or early redemption risk.
                              </p>
<p>In some cases, market values are close to carrying amounts. This
                              applies primarily to:

                              OTC derivatives (i.e. those traded over the counter) various adjustments
                              linked to the default risk and credit quality (Credit Valuation Adjustment,
                              Debit Valuation Adjustment) and also to future funding costs and benefits
                              (Funding Valuation Adjustment).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CVA ADJUSTMENT</h4>
<p>The Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment
                              that aims to price into the fair value of the OTC derivatives the
                              market value of our counterparties' default risk (risk that amounts
                              due to us are not repaid in the event of default or deterioration
                              in creditworthiness). This adjustment is calculated per counterparty
                              based on the positive future exposure of the trading portfolio (taking
                              into account any netting or collateral agreements, where such exist)
                              weighted by the probabilities of default by our counterparties and
                              losses given default. The estimated methodology of the CVA used maximises
                              the use of observable entry data (the probability of default is in
                              priority, directly deduced from listed CDS, listed CDS proxies, or
                              other credit instruments when they are judged sufficiently liquid).
                              This adjustment is always negative and reduces the fair value of the
                              OTC derivative assets held in the portfolio.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DVA ADJUSTMENT</h4>
<p>The Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment
                              that aims to price into the fair value of OTC derivatives the market
                              value of our own default risk (potential losses to which Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. may expose its counterparties in the event of default or a deterioration
                              in its creditworthiness). This adjustment is calculated on the scope
                              of the trading securities covered by a perfect/Golden Credit Support
                              Annex (CSA) and based on the negative future exposure profiles of
                              the trading portfolio weighted by the probability of default (by CASA)
                              and the loss incurred given default. The calculation aims to factor
                              in the Margin Period of Risk (MPR, which is calculated as the sum:
                              "periodicity of the collateral contract" + "estimate of the time necessary
                              for the liquidation of the portfolio"). The methodology for estimating
                              the DVA used maximises the use of observable entry data (use of the
                              CASA CDS to determine the probability of default). This adjustment
                              is always positive and reduces the fair value of the OTC derivative
                              liabilities held in the portfolio.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">FVA ADJUSTMENT</h4>
<p>The Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment
                              that aims to price into the fair value of OTC derivatives the additional
                              future funding costs and benefits based on Asset &amp; Liabilities
                              Management (ALM) costs. This adjustment is calculated based on the
                              scope of the trading securities not covered by a Credit Support Index
                              (CSA) or covered by an imperfect/Golden CSA and based on future (positive
                              and negative) exposure profiles weighted by the spreads of ALM funding.

<p>Level 1 comprises all derivatives quoted in an active market (options,
                              futures, etc.), regardless of their underlying (interest rate, exchange
                              rate, precious metals, key stock indices), as well as equities and
                              bonds quoted in an active market.
                              </p>
<p>A market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily
                              and regularly available from an exchange, broker, dealer, pricing
                              service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and
                              regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.
                              </p>
<p>Corporate and government bonds and agencies that are valued on

<p>On the scope of interest rate derivatives, two principal factors
                              are considered as unobservable and involve the classification of products

<p>The prepayment rate is the rate of early repayment on securitisation

                              this risk factor can stem from two types of sources: firstly, direct
                              exposure to these asset classes and, secondly, certain so-called "securitisation"
                              swaps, i.e. where changes in the nominal amount automatically adjust
                              to the nominal amount of the underlying portfolio with no mark-to-market
                              payment. The prepayment rate plays a significant part in their valuation.

<p>The result of the stress test is then obtained by adding up the

                              values by currency and by book, therefore assuming that the correlations
                              were not correlated among themselves. For the CMS correlations, we
                              considered the various underlyings independently (e.g. 1y10y, 2y10y).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">With respect

                              </h4>
<p>Direct exposure to assets comprising a prepayment risk concerns
                              securitisations such as RMBS and CLO and mezzanine CDO tranches. These
                              exposures are marginal. They can be taken into account through sensitivity
                              to a 1 bp change in credit spreads. This sensitivity being very low
                              (&lt;€50,000/bp), exposure to prepayment rate is thus considered to
                              be negligible.
                              </p>
<p>The prepayment rate is not an observable market input and the valuation
                              model used for the securitisation swaps is particularly conservative.
                              The valuation used is defined as the lower of the valuation obtained
                              using a very fast prepayment rate and using a very slow prepayment
                              rate. A "normal" variance in the prepayment rate will therefore have
                              no material impact on mark-to-market, no Day One thus being used for
                              these products.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has contractual arrangements with some consolidated
                              structured entities under Group control that equate to commitments
                              to provide financial support.
                              </p>
<p>To meet its funding needs Crédit Agricole CIB uses structured debt
                              issuance vehicles to raise cash on financial markets. The securities
                              issued by these entities are fully underwritten by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB. At 31 December 2017, the outstanding volume of these issues was
                              €24 billion.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its third-party securitisation business, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB provides liquidity lines to its ABCP conduits. At 31 December
                              2017, these liquidity lines totalled €32 billion.

<p>In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General
                              Meeting of Shareholders, we have audited the accompanying consolidated
                              financial statements of Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank
                              for the year ended 31 December 2017.
                              </p>
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true

<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards

                              of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating
                              to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement,
                              were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial
                              statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.
                              </p>
<p>These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated
                              financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the
                              opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate

                              OF RISK
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank is subject to a number
                              of investigations and requests for regulatory information from different
                              regulators. These procedures concern in particular the Euribor/Libor
                              and SSA Bonds matters with authorities from various countries (USA,
                              UK, Switzerland) and the European Union.
                              </p>
<p>A number of tax investigations are also ongoing in some of the
                              countries in which the Group operates.
                              </p>
<p>As stated in Notes 1.3 and 6.18 to the consolidated financial statements,
                              the assessment of risks at the reporting date is based on management's
                              best assessment, in view of the information in its possession.
                              </p>
<p>Deciding whether or not to recognise a provision and the amount
                              of that provision requires the use of judgement, given that it is
                              difficult to assess the outcome of disputes or the final tax impacts
                              of certain structural transactions.
                              </p>
<p>We deemed the measurement of these provisions to be a key audit
                              matter, considering their sensitivity to the assumptions used by management.

<p>Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investmet Bank originates and structures

                              </p>
<p>Receivables recorded in the balance sheet at amortised cost are
                              impaired where there is an objective indication of impairment resulting
                              from one or more loss events occurring after the loan has been granted.
                              Receivables may be impaired individually or collectively, for a group
                              of exposures with similar characteristics.
                              </p>
<p>The measurement of credit impairments requires judgement to be
                              made and may be complex where the financing is granted to companies
                              operating in economic sectors with an uncertain or deteriorated outlook.
                              We deemed loans granted to companies operating in the shipping, oil
                              and gas industries to be a key audit matter given the complexity in
                              identifying exposures (or homogeneous groups of exposures) where there
                              is a risk of non-recovery and in determining recoverable future flows.

<p>The reliability of IT systems is critical for financial institutions

                              In these circumstances, our audit approach relies on certain controls

                              AND AUDIT APPROACH
                              </h4>
<p>Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements.
                              Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
                              consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material
                              misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
                              is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional
                              standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
                              Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
                              if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
                              to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
                              these consolidated financial statements.
                              </p>
<p>As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code,
                              our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of
                              management of the company.
                              </p>
<p>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards
                              applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional
                              judgement throughout the audit.

<p>These are loans to counterparties in financial difficulty, such
                              that the credit institution alters their initial characteristics (term,
                              interest rate, etc.) to allow the conterparties to honour the repayment
                              schedule.
                              </p>
<p>They consist of loans classified as in default and performing loans
                              at the date they are restructured.
                              </p>
<p>Restructured loans do not include loans whose characteristics have
                              been renegotiated on a commercial basis with counterparties not showing
                              any insolvency problems.

<p>The reduction of future flows granted to a counterparty, or the
                              postponing of these flows as part of a restructuring, results in the
                              recognition of a discount. It represents future loss of cash flow
                              discounted at the original effective interest rate.
                              </p>

<p>The discount recognised when a loan is restructured is recorded

                              </p>
<p>Restructured loans are rated in accordance with Basel rules and
                              are impaired on the basis of the estimated credit risk. They are individually
                              impaired within thirty days of a missed payment.

<p>Subject to certain conditions, in lieu of the above criteria, the

                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DOUBTFUL LOANS</h4>
<p>All doubtful loans which do not fall into the irrecoverable loans
                              category are classified as doubtful loans.
                              </p>

<p>Irrecoverable loans are those for which the prospects of recovery
                              are highly impaired and which are likely to be written off in time.
                              </p>
<p>In the case of doubtful loans, interest continues to be recognised
                              so long as the receivable is deemed to be doubtful, but is no longer
                              recognised after the loss has been transferred to irrecoverable loans.

<p>Once a loan is classified as doubtful, an impairment loss is deducted
                              by Crédit Agricole CIB from the asset in an amount equal to the probable
                              loss. These impairment losses represent the difference between the
                              carrying amount of the receivable and estimated future cash flows
                              discounted at the contractual rate, taking into account the borrower's
                              financial condition, its business prospects and any guarantees, after
                              deducting the cost of enforcing such guarantees.

<p>Possible losses in respect of portfolios of small loans with similar
                              characteristics may be estimated on a statistical basis rather than

                              systematically recognised under "Goodwill"; they must be recognised
                              in the balance sheet depending on asset items to which they are allocated

                              assets, etc.". The loss is amortised, impaired and written off in

<p>Purchased software is measured at purchase price less accumulated

                              </h4>
<p>In accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07 of 26 November 2014,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB makes a Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) to the
                              market value of its derivative assets to reflect counterparty risk.
                              For this reason, Credit Valuation Adjustments are only made to derivatives
                              recognised as isolated open positions and as part of a trading portfolio
                              (derivatives classified in categories "a" and "d" Article 2522-1 of
                              the aforementioned regulation).
                              </p>
<p>The CVA makes it possible to calculate counterparty losses expected
                              by Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              </p>
<p>The CVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected losses
                              based on the probability of default and loss given default. The methodology
                              used maximises the use of observable market inputs.

                              2013-02 of 7 November 2013 relating to the measurement and recognition
                              of retirement and similar benefit obligations, such recommendation
                              having then been repealed and incorporated in section 4 of chapter
                              II of part III of ANC Regulation 2014-03 of 5 June 2014.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with this regulation, Crédit Agricole CIB sets aside

                              falling within the category of defined-benefit plans.
                              </p>
<p>These obligations are stated on the basis of actuarial, financial
                              and demographic assumptions, and in accordance with the projected
                              unit credit method. Under this method, for each year of service, a
                              charge is booked in an amount corresponding to the employee's vested
                              benefits for the period. The charge is calculated based on the discounted
                              future benefit.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB elected to immediately recognise the actuarial
                              gains and losses in profit or loss, and accordingly the amount of
                              the provision is equal to:

                              the limitation period was received late 2017. Crédit Agricole CIB
                              is challenging the proposed adjustments. A provision has been recognised

<p>In October 2015, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank
                              (Crédit Agricole CIB) and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              reached agreements with the US and New York authorities that had been
                              conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions with countries
                              subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement
                              took place between 2003 and 2008.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and Crédit Agricole S.A., which cooperated
                              with the US and New York authorities in connection with their investigations,
                              have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e.
                              €692.7 million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to
                              the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore,
                              has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.
                              </p>
<p>The agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
                              System (Federal Reserve) and the New-York State Department of Financial
                              Services (NYDFS) are with CASA and Crédit Agricole CIB. The agreement
                              with the Oftice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department
                              of the Treasury is with Crédit Agricole CIB. Crédit Agricole CIB also
                              entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with
                              the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO)
                              and the District Attorney of the County of New York (DANY), the terms
                              of which are three years. The USAO and DANY have agreed to take no
                              further action against Crédit Agricole CIB, CASA, or any of Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's subsidiaries or affiliates regarding the conduct subject
                              to this investigation if Crédit Agricole CIB complies with its obligations
                              under the DPAs.
                              </p>
<p>Within the framework of the implementation of these agreements,
                              Crédit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and
                              its compliance programs regarding laws on international sanctions
                              and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York authorities
                              regarding this matter, with its home regulators, the European Central
                              Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority
                              (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.

<p>Pursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve,
                              Crédit Agricole's compliance program is subject to regular reviews
                              to evaluate its effectiveness, including a review by an independent
                              consultant appointed by NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews
                              by an independent consultant approved by the Federal Reserve.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A.,
                              in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank rates,

                              as part of investigations into: (i) the calculation of the Libor (London
                              Interbank Offered Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro
                              Interbank Offered Rate) and certain other market indices; and (ii)
                              transactions connected with these rates and indices. These demands
                              covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its cooperation with the authorities, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB and its holding company Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out investigations
                              in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities
                              and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of
                              Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with which
                              they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the
                              outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Crédit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation
                              opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the
                              Libor and the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>Following its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure,
                              on 21 May 2014, the European Commission sent a notification of grievances
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A. and to Crédit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements
                              or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing,
                              restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the
                              Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>In a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly
                              fined Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB €114,654,000 for
                              participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are challenging this decision
                              and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn it.
                              </p>
<p>Additionally, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, is conducting
                              an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including
                              the Euribor, with regard to Crédit Agricole S.A. and several Swiss
                              and international banks. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition
                              authority (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September
                              2015 into Crédit Agricole CIB and the Libor index on various currencies,
                              Euribor and Tibor indices. The KFTC investigation into certain foreign
                              exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) is ongoing.

                              Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ("Lieberman" for Libor),
                              the "Lieberman" class action is at the preliminary stage that consists
                              in the examination of its admissibility; proceedings are still suspended
                              before the US District Court of New York State. Concerning the"Sullivan"
                              class action, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB introduced
                              a motion to dismiss the applicants' claim. The US District Court of
                              New York State upheld the motion to dismiss regarding Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB in first instance. This decision is subject
                              to appeal.
                              </p>
<p>Since 1 July 2016, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB,
                              together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit
                              in the United States ("Frontpoint") relating to the SIBOR (Singapore
                              Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indices.
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to
                              dismiss. The New York Federal Court, ruling in first instance, granted
                              this request last August 18th, in favor of Crédit Agricole S.A. and
                              Crédit Agricole CIB. Following federal procedure which allows them
                              to do so, the plaintiffs modified the terms of their action to refer
                              the case to the judge again. As a consequence, Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and Crédit Agricole CIB have submitted a new motion to dismiss, which
                              must be examined by the New York Federal Court soon.
                              </p>
<p>These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim
                              that they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor,
                              SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek repayment of the sums they allege were
                              unlawfully received, as well as damages and reimbursement of costs
                              and fees paid.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ BONDS SSA</h4>
<p>Several regulators have demanded information to Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and to Crédit Agricole CIB for inquiries relating to activities
                              of different banks involved on Bonds SSA market (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign
                              and Agencies). Crédit Agricole CIB is included with other banks in
                              various consolidated class actions before the United States District
                              Court for the Southern District of New York. Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and Crédit Agricole CIB are included with other banks in two class
                              actions filed in Canada, one before the Ontario Superior Court of
                              Justice and the other before the Federal Court. Through the cooperation
                              with these regulators, Crédit Agricole CIB proceeded to internal inquiries
                              to gather the required information. It is not possible at this stage
                              to predict the outcome of these investigations or class actions or
                              the date on which they will end.

                              of CDS recognised as hedging, over the course of several prior financial

<p>In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General
                              Meeting of Shareholders, we have audited the accompanying financial
                              statements of Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank for the
                              year ended 31 December 2017.
                              </p>
<p>In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view
                              of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the
                              Group as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operations
                              for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial

                              </p>
<p>The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report
                              to the Audit Committee.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ AUDIT FRAMEWORK</h4>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards
                              applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
                              is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
                              </p>
<p>Our responsibilities under these standards are further described
                              in the Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the
                              audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">♦ INDEPENDENCE</h4>
<p>We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence
                              rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January 2017 to the
                              date of our report and in particular we did not provide any non-audit
                              services prohibited by article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014
                              or the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie).

<p>In accordance with the requirements of articles L.823-9 and R.823-7

                              of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating
                              to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement,
                              were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements,
                              as well as how we addressed those risks.
                              </p>
<p>These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial
                              statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we
                              formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on
                              specific items of the financial statements.

                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank Is subject to a number
                              of investigations and requests for regulatory information from different
                              regulators. These procedures concern in particular the Euribor/Libor
                              and SSA Bonds matters with authorities from various countries (USA,
                              UK, Switzerland) and the European Union.
                              </p>
<p>A number of tax investigations are also ongoing in some of the
                              countries in which the Group operates.
                              </p>
<p>As stated in Notes 1.6 and 13 to the financial statements, the
                              assessment of risks at the reporting date is based on management's
                              best assessment, in view of the information in its possession.
                              </p>
<p>Deciding whether or not to recognise a provision and the amount
                              of that provision requires the use of judgement, given that it is
                              difficult to assess the outcome of disputes or the final tax impacts
                              of certain structural transactions.
                              </p>
<p>We deemed the measurement of these provisions to be a key audit
                              matter, considering their sensitivity to the assumptions used by management.

                              recognised as liabilities. Crédit Agricole CIB also books provisions
                              on the liabilities side of the balance sheet to cover customer risks
                              that are not individually allocated to loans, such as country risk

<p>The measurement of credit impairments requires judgement to be

                              and gas industries to be a key audit matter given the complexity in

<p>We gained an understanding of the processes and controls put in
                              place by Crédit Agricole CIB to identify, measure and recognise derivative
                              financial instruments, and specifically level 3 instruments.
                              </p>
<p>We examined key controls such as the independent approval of valuation
                              models and the independent verification of valuation inputs by the
                              Risk Management and Permanent Control department as well as the procedure
                              for recognising these instruments and their accounting classification.
                              </p>
<p>We included specialists in our audit team to carry out independent
                              valuations and analyse the valuations carried out by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB. Our work covered various types of complex derivative financial
                              instruments across the entire fair value hierarchy of financial assets
                              and liabilities.
                              </p>
<p>For the valuation of complex derivative financial instruments using
                              internal models and/or unobservable data, we examined the assumptions,
                              methodologies and models used by the bank to estimate the main valuation
                              adjustments.
                              </p>
<p>We also examined the valuations carried out by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB against the main differences in existing margin calls and losses
                              and/or gains in the event.

<p>Individual user access rights to IT systems are granted to different
                              employees of the bank depending on their duties. The management of
                              these authorisations is important since it ensures that (functional
                              and technical) users are authorised to access the applications (and
                              their underlying infrastructure) and to make changes, thus limiting
                              the risk of fraud or error as a result of unauthorised changes to
                              the application settings or underlying data.
                              </p>
<p>The reliability of IT systems is critical for financial institutions
                              given the high volume of transactions processed on a daily basis.
                              In these circumstances, our audit approach relies on certain controls
                              relating to the management of IT systems.
                              </p>

                              assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
                              an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will
                              always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
                              can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
                              or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
                              the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
                              statements.
                              </p>
<p>As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code,
                              our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of
                              management of the company.
                              </p>
<p>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards
                              applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional

<p>On December 7th 2016, the European Commission pronounced a fine
                              of € 114,654 million on your Company and Crédit Agricole S.A. which
                              were considered to be jointly and severally liable after an investigation
                              carried out by the Commission concluding on the existence of a cartel
                              among seven banking institutions on interest-rate derivatives in euros
                              by agreeing on the determination of the reference rate Euribor. The
                              alleged facts would have occurred between September 2005 and May 2008.
                              </p>
<p>From the delivery of the Commission's judgement, your Company announced
                              it would appeal against the decision before the General Court of the
                              European Union. The revocation motion was filed in on February 17,
                              2017.
                              </p>
<p>As the appeal did not stay the judgement, your Company had to pay
                              the full amount due before March 5, 2017.
                              </p>
<p>Based on an agreement signed with Crédit Agricole S.A., your Company
                              accepted to pay the full amount of the penalty on behalf of the two
                              jointly and severally sentenced institutions and returned the fine's

                              Agricole S.A.'s Chief Executive Officer. The penalty has been paid

<p>Your Board justified the convention in the following manner:</p>
<p>Since the Commission's decision did not include any precise details
                              regarding the distribution of the payment between the contractual
                              parties, it left them to conventionally determine the proportionate
                              share in the penalty assigned to each of them, in accordance with
                              the established case-law of the European Court of Justice.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Crédit Agricole S.A. and your Company have challenged
                              the Commission's decision, as a result of which, although the fine
                              is payable immediately, there is a possibility it might subsequently
                              be withdrawn.
                              </p>
<p>It is recalled that the provisional payment of this penalty complies
                              with the missions of Crédit Agricole S.A., which, as a central body,
                              guarantees the liquidity and solvency of all its affiliates, including

<p>At its meeting of 12 December 2017, your Board of Directors authorised
                              the transfer of ownership of the Banking Services Department as described
                              above by means of a business disposal agreement effective 1 January
                              2018. As of that date, your Company has operated the business transferred,
                              including all human and material resources.
                              </p>
<p>However, for operational reasons and, in particular, the migration
                              of information systems, your Company was not able to open accounts
                              for Banking Services customers on the transfer date. Consequently,
                              accounts opened by customers will be administered by Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. during a transition period and will be opened by your Company
                              during and before the end of the transition period according to a
                              schedule based on progress made in the work to be done by your Company,
                              which is expected to be completed no later than 31 December 2020.
                              During this transition period, Crédit Agricole S.A. will transfer
                              back to your Company any income generated on the transactions of the
                              transferred business that it receives from Banking Services customers.
                              In parallel, all charges, costs and liabilities incurred by Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. in respect of the transferred business will be borne
                              by your Company.
                              </p>
<p>The price of the business disposal was agreed at EUR 57,000.</p>
<p>As the business disposal agreement is not a routine business transaction
                              for Crédit Agricole S.A. or your Company and thus cannot be considered
                              as a transaction in the normal course of business on arm's length
                              terms, it qualifies as a related-party agreement governed by the provisions
                              of Article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code.

<p>Your Board of Directors has justified the agreement as follows:</p>
<p>The purpose of transferring the Banking Services business is to

                              staff expertise, share tools and improve process security. The transfer
                              will also enable your Company to expand its offering to include correspondent
                              banking services and, therefore, to expand and upgrade its cash management
                              services, particularly for financial institutions, while providing
                              customers with better clarity about its organisation.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole Group will therefore be able to better adapt to
                              new regulatory or market requirements and to customer needs, while
                              reducing expenses and optimising future investments.

<p>On its meeting held on December 12, 2017, the Board of Directors
                              of Crédit Agricole S.A. authorized the transfer of Crédit Agricole
                              S.A.'s information technology activities (MSI) to Global IT (GIT)
                              which ensures the same missions on Crédit Agricole CIB's perimeter.
                              </p>
<p>The transfer of the divested activity will take place on January

<p>The transfer itself does not constitute a regulated agreement but,

<p>During a six to twelve months transition period from the transfer
                              date, some Credit Agricole Group's entities could benefit from MSI
                              services by signed quotes. Billing and recovery services would be
                              carried out by Crédit Agricole S.A. under a billing and collection
                              mandate, which includes, in particular, Crédit Agricole S.A.'s warranty
                              to your Company referring to the recovery, towards the beneficiary
                              entities, of Crédit Agricole S.A.'s billings in the name of and on

<p>At the end of this transitional period, your Company could decide,

                              entities, through another Crédit Agricole Group's entity, depending
                              on the result of the work carried out during the transitional period,

                              set at €3.6 million.
                              </p>
<p>In exchange of that lease firm commitment, your Company consented
                              to Crédit Agricole Indosuez Wealth (France) a franchise for 36 months'
                              rent ending on 30 June 2017. Development work began in 2014, for which
                              your Company was committed. The total amount of work at the charge
                              of your Company in 2017 was €5.22 million excluding tax.
                              </p>
<p>Through the game of the escalator clause, the annual rent invoiced
                              to your Company amounts €3.53 million for FY 2017. As planned by the
                              sub-leasing agreement, Crédit Agricole Indosuez Wealth (France) pays
                              out the rent in its entirety since the 1 July 2017.
