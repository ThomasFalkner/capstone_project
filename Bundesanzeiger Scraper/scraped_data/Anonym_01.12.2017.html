<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">A WHOLE BANK JUST
                              FOR YOU</h4>
<p>Thanks to its universal customer-focused banking model - based on close cooperation
                              between its retail banks and its specialised business lines - reaffirmed by its new
                              "A whole bank just for you" brand signature, Crédit Agricole helps its customers to
                              realise all their personal and business projects. It does so by offering them an extensive
                              range of services consisting of day-to-day banking, loans, savings products, insurance,
                              asset management, real estate, leasing and factoring, corporate and investment banking,
                              issuer and investor services.
                              </p>
<p>Serving 52 million customers worldwide, it also stands out on account of its distribution
                              model, multi-channel customer-focused banking, and the efforts of its 138,000 employees,
                              who make Crédit Agricole the Customer Relationship-based bank.
                              </p>
<p>Built on its strong cooperative and mutual foundations and led by its 9.3 million
                              mutual shareholders and almost 31,000 directors of its Local and Regional Banks, Crédit
                              Agricoles organisational model gives it stability and staying power. It also draws
                              its strength from its values of transparency, customer focus, accountability and openness
                              to the world and from local communities, which it has cultivated over 120 years.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricoles corporate social responsibility policy lies at the heart of its
                              identity
                              as a helpful and responsive bank over the long term. It is reflected in its products
                              and services and informs the actions of all its business lines. It is a key factor
                              contributing to overall performance and a powerful innovation driver.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole Group extends its leadership year after year. It is the number
                              one
                              provider of financing to the French economy and the number one insurer in France.
                              It is also the first bancassurer in Europe, the first European asset manager and the
                              world's second-largest provider of green financing.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">MESSAGE FROM THE
                              CHAIRMAN AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER</h4>
<p>2016 was a key year, marked by transformation. During this period we presented
                              our
                              medium term plan - Strategic Ambition 2020 - and one of its major achievements: the
                              simplification of the Group's organisation with the transfer of Crédit Agricole S.A.'s
                              stake in the Regional banks to a company owned by them, Sacam Mutualisation. This
                              clarifies Crédit Agricole Group's structure and normalises Crédit Agricole S.A.'s
                              solvency. The Group is among the strongest banking institutions in Europe. The projected
                              acquisition of Pioneer Investments should also be mentioned. It will make Amundi the
                              eighth largest asset manager in the world. In a totally different area and to comply
                              with resolution rules, we were the first institution to issue a new kind of senior
                              non-preferred debt within the framework of the Sapin 2 law. These projects illustrate
                              the Group's agility, its ability to adapt, to transform and to conduct major strategic
                              transactions within a short time frame.
                              </p>
<p>Our results are consistent with the projections we had made, based on a cautious
                              analysis
                              of our environment. The results published for the financial year 2016 are strong,
                              and confirm the relevance of our prudential path. The commercial and financial performance
                              of our business lines is excellent. Premium Client Solutions in particular benefited
                              from a strong momentum in its businesses within a constrained environment, its underlying
                              net banking income increasing by +5.5% over the year. We are confident in our assets
                              and in the mobilisation of all the Group's employees to continue to make Crédit Agricole
                              an essential player in the economic development of the countries in which we are established.

<b>&gt; PHILIPPE BRASSAC</b>
</p>
<p>Chairman of the Board of Directors of Crédit Agricole CIB</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A.</p>
<p>Our results for 2016 are very satisfactory. With costs under control and significant
                              revenue growth, Crédit Agricole CIB is in line with the goals set by our medium term
                              plan Strategic Ambition 2020. Crédit Agricole CIB maintained its strong positions
                              thanks to the recognised expertise of its financing business lines, and gained market
                              share in market and investment banking business lines. The Bank is now ready to face
                              future regulatory challenges.
                              </p>
<p>Our strength lies in our commercial approach: to support our partners and clients.
                              First among which Crédit Agricole itself, the clients of the Regional banks, of LCL
                              and Cariparma, large corporates, the clients of our structured finance activity and
                              institutional investors.
                              </p>
<p>One of our priorities is to strengthen the Group's growth in its core businesses.
                              In order to achieve this, Prime Client Solutions was created in 2016. It groups Crédit
                              Agricole CIB, CACEIS, Indosuez Wealth Management and Crédit Agricole Private Banking
                              Services.
                              </p>
<p>With its robust and efficient business model, Crédit Agricole CIB participates
                              fully
                              in the Group's growth momentum and in serving its clients all over the world.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2 2016 HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<p>The economic situation in 2016 suffered from a good deal of uncertainty due to
                              some
                              major political events: at times, Brexit, the American Presidential elections and
                              the referendum in Italy caused volatility in the financial markets. The slowdown in
                              the Energy and Shipping sectors over the year also affected the main players of these
                              businesses inducing a higher cost of risk for the Bank. Finally, the regulatory environment,
                              which is still very demanding, required even more reactivity and effort from all CIBs.
                              </p>
<p>In this complex environment, the Bank enjoyed year-on-year revenue growth of 8%,
                              driven
                              mainly by a very good performance from the capital market activities and the healthy
                              revenues from the financing activities, despite a difficult operating environment.
                              </p>
<p>Regarding financing activities, Crédit Agricole CIB confirmed its position as leader
                              in aircraft financing<sup>(1)</sup> and took fourth place both worldwide and in the

<p>In line with the objectives of the Medium-Term Plan 2016-2019, a selective approach
                              was taken to growing the corporate client base by further developing the most profitable
                              relationships. The process of increasing the importance of financial institutions
                              in the portfolio is well underway, thanks to the strong growth of the Repo business
                              this year the Bank reached the second place worldwide (vs sixth in 2015) for euro-denominated
                              bond issues for financial institutions<sup>(5)</sup> .

<p>2016 was also the year in which the Large Customers Division became a reality,
                              a move
                              intended to strengthen and systematise the commercial synergies between Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, CACEIS and Indosuez Wealth Management. One of the initiatives of this Division
                              has been to create a joint service and product offer including Private Equity, Real
                              Estate and Infrastructures funds managed by a joint hub involving the three entities.
                              </p>
<p>The Bank continues to develop worldwide. It has consolidated its franchise in the
                              United States and in Asia for both corporate clients and financial institutions. It
                              has also strengthened its client coverage in the Middle East.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, 2016 also saw the final move by the Bank to the two main campuses of the
                              Crédit Agricole Group, Evergreen in Montrouge and SQY Park in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.

                              employees as agents of sustainable development in their work, in order to assess and
                              manage direct or indirect environmental risks.
                              </p>
<p>Client managers and senior bankers are responsible for analysing environmental
                              and
                              social challenges related to their business area. Whenever necessary, they call on
                              the Sustainable Development team, and the most complex transactions from an environmental
                              or social point of view are also submitted to the Committee for the Evaluation of
                              Transactions with an Environmental or Social Risk (CERES).
                              </p>
<p>Because it is becoming increasingly aware of the sustainable development challenges
                              of the activity (expanded field of application for the Equator Principles, CSR sector
                              policies, scoring of corporate clients, etc.) and the central role of employees in
                              this system, the Bank places great importance on employee awareness and training.
                              An awareness-raising plan for all employees was completed in 2013. In 2014, a map
                              of training needs was completed. The highest-priority training programmes were finalised
                              in 2015, and were implemented from 2015.

                              WEALTH MANAGEMENT CSR APPROACH</h4>
<p>Created and structured at the first dedicated committee meeting in October 2015,
                              Indosuez
                              Wealth Management's CSR approach is based on three main priorities: a Human Resources
                              priority, a customer/product priority and an institutional priority. These priorities
                              fall under the responsibility of one or two members of the Management Committee and
                              involve employees from the entities in question.
                              </p>
<p>They focus on a number of workshops and initiatives which will be introduced in
                              the
                              early stages of the FReD action plans (see after). The initiatives run are listed
                              and analysed and then discussed at special six-monthly meetings. Since the new brand
                              launch in January 2016, the Indosuez Wealth Management Group's global intranet incorporates
                              a CSR section.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, CFM Indosuez Wealth Management decided to adopt an approach which involved
                              employees at all levels, injected new life into its initiatives and involved it in
                              the creation of the Indosuez Wealth Management Group's sustainable development policies
                              within a set of standards. The intention is for this approach to be deployed by the
                              other Indosuez Wealth Management Group entities. The aim is to gain a better understanding
                              of the basic principles of CSR, and the FReD initiatives, in order to familiarise
                              itself with the CSR issues which employees come up against in their jobs.

                              EVENTS IN 2016</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">INITIAL RESULTS
                              OF THE INDOSUEZ WEALTH MANAGEMENT CSR WORKSHOPS</h4>
<p>Since being introduced, the CSR workshops have produced some concrete results.
                              Topics
                              have been defined, organisations fine-tuned and actions scheduled.
                              </p>
<p>For the Human Resources priority, it was decided to give life to the seven social
                              commitments of the Respect pillar and to build a relationship of trust among employees
                              while introducing a unified diversity policy. Plans were also made to incorporate
                              the wishes expressed during the manager training programme IndosuezManagementWay and
                              to take stock of the initiatives run by the Indosuez Wealth Management Foundations
                              in France and Switzerland.
                              </p>
<p>The Respect pillar of FReD therefore sets out to achieve greater gender equality
                              in
                              the management bodies and changes to managerial practices and the commercial business
                              lines. A common compensation management tool was to be introduced and the employability
                              of employees to be improved.
                              </p>
<p>For the customer/product priority, CSR becomes a key performance criterion which
                              is
                              sought by an increasing number of investors. It was therefore decided to introduce
                              a socially responsible investment (SRI) rating system at all entities, to promote
                              the SRI rating of the portfolios to customers and sales teams, and to set up a "carbon
                              impact" rating in our IT system.
                              </p>
<p>Several product initiatives were also introduced, such as selecting themed funds
                              (Low
                              carbon, etc.), examining the relevance of SRI management, promoting real estate funds
                              and setting up a special CSR fund.
                              </p>
<p>The institutional priority, also known as the "social economy priority", combines
                              economic development with the challenges of sustainable development. Key to this priority
                              is solidarity which extends beyond the actions of the Indosuez Foundations. Topics
                              discussed included the Grameen Crédit Agricole Foundation, financial education in
                              schools and hour banks for caregiver employees.
                              </p>

                              PROGRESS-DRIVEN APPROACH</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and CA Indosuez Wealth Management are fully involved in the
                              Crédit
                              Agricole Group's FReD progress-driven approach. For each participating entity, the
                              process intended to strengthen CSR within the Group consists in 15 action plans focused
                              on three key areas involving clients (Fides), employees (Respect) and the environment
                              (Demeter). Specific and measurable objectives are defined for each plan, with an overall
                              goal of advancing two levels per year on a progress scale consisting of five levels.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the average level of progress recorded by the 15 action plans of Crédit
                              Agricole
                              CIB was 2.2.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the average level of progress recorded by the action plans of the Indosuez
                              Wealth Management Group was 2.3.

                              PARTICIPATIVE APPROACH</h4>
<p>In order to make the FReD process even more participatory, a call for projects
                              was
                              launched in 2014, asking Crédit Agricole CIB employees to suggest ideas for new FReD
                              action plans, and to prepare specific action plans for each of the three pillars,
                              Fides, Respect and Demeter.
                              </p>
<p>52 proposals were received and examined in 2015. Of the ten proposals selected
                              by
                              a panel comprising representatives from Compliance, Human Resources, Sustainable Development
                              and Communications, six FReD initiatives were launched in 2016.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ GOVERNANCE</h4>
<p>Sustainable development challenges are taken into account by Crédit Agricole CIB
                              in
                              accordance with the general guidelines proposed by the Sustainable Development Department
                              of Crédit Agricole S.A. and validated by the Sustainable Development Committee of
                              the Crédit Agricole Group. They are the subject of two internal governance documents
                              that define the framework.
                              </p>
<p>A Sustainable Development Department, which reports to the Corporate Secretary,
                              co-ordinates
                              the implementation of Crédit Agricole CIB's sustainable development actions.
                              </p>
<p>An ad hoc committee, CERES, chaired by the head of the Compliance function, acts
                              as
                              the top-level committee of the system for evaluating and managing environmental and
                              social risks related to the activity. More specifically, this committee issues recommendations
                              prior to the Credit Committee meeting for all transactions whose environmental or
                              social impact it feels need close monitoring. The CERES Committee validates the ratings
                              of the transactions in accordance with the Equator Principles, issues opinions and
                              recommendations on transactions classified as sensitive in respect of environmental
                              and social aspects, and approves the CSR sector policies prior to their validation
                              by the Strategies and Portfolios Committee.
                              </p>
<p>The CERES Committee met six times in 2016 to discuss agenda items which included:
                              reviewing transactions signed during the year and validating ratings based on the
                              Equator Principles, monitoring of sensitive cases, validating draft sector policies
                              prior to their presentation to the Strategies and Portfolios Committee, and presentation
                              of the conclusions of several FReD plans.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the CERES Committee specifically reviewed 20 transactions before they
                              were
                              sent to the Credit Committee, given their importance and the sensitivity of the potential
                              environmental or social impacts. Its recommendations led in one instance to a decision
                              not to pursue a commercial opportunity and in three instances to impose special conditions
                              for environmental and social risk management.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, while continuing to implement FReD actions, the Wealth Management business
                              line introduced a structured CSR policy in order to implement its dedicated sustainable
                              development organisation.
                              </p>
<p>The Indosuez Wealth Management Group CSR Committee, set up to support the CSR process,
                              met in April and November 2016 to ensure that all of the strategic CSR priorities
                              and guidelines, decided in late 2015, had indeed been implemented.

<p>In addition to the regular contact we have with them, we also held a special consultation
                              with our main stakeholders (customers, employees, civil society, etc.) in 2016 to
                              supplement the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group materiality analysis.

                              GROUP'S MATERIALITY ANALYSIS TO CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANKING</h4>
<p>This involved, on the one hand, meeting up with around ten customers, four NGOs
                              representing
                              diverse societal issues, union representatives, work-study trainees, the main in-house
                              buyers from the purchasing department and representatives from other Crédit Agricole
                              Group structures, and, on the other hand, incorporating the results of the various
                              existing benchmarks and studies (baseline customer satisfaction score, CSR benchmark,
                              etc.).

<p>Independently of the results of the Crédit Agricole S.A. materiality study, which
                              require to be adapted to the specific requirements of Crédit Agricole CIB, three key
                              priorities were highlighted: the first was innovation in customer relations in a market
                              where the environment and customer sales models are rapidly changing; the second was
                              to develop, establish and share good practices, an area which is particularly important
                              to Crédit Agricole CIB and in which it has always tried to take a leading role; the
                              third was to encourage all employees to embrace the notion of Corporate Social Responsibility.
                              </p>
<p>Our support for cultural initiatives is described in section 6.3 and our relationship
                              with schools and universities is set out in section 6.4.

                              TRUST</h4>
<p>At Crédit Agricole CIB, it is the Compliance Department (CPL), which monitors and
                              manages the risks of non-compliance. CPL's mission is to promote respect of compliance
                              rules in the activities and operations of the Bank and of its employees with laws
                              and regulations as well as internal and external rules applicable to the activities
                              of Crédit Agricole CIB in banking and financial fields, or which can result in penal
                              sanctions, sanctions from regulators, disputes with clients and more widely in reputational

                              </p>
<p>The Compliance function aims at strengthening the confidence of the stakeholders
                              involved
                              (clients, employees, investors, regulators, suppliers) in respect of these rules and
                              their implementation.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB Global Compliance Department, alongside the Human Resources
                              Department and the Sustainable Development business lines, is firmly committed to
                              the FReD CSR process, and for several years it has been working on Fides, the economic
                              component, by making a commitment on five renewable actions each year. These actions

<p>The Bank has a secure process of entering into a relationship with the client and
                              of overseeing the selling of market products. Customer protection passes through a
                              comprehensive customer classification system, which not only applies the MIF rules
                              applicable in the European Economic Area (increased protection of non-business customers
                              who receive an investment service), but also worldwide through an "Internal suitability
                              rating". This system forms part of the sales process, in particular so that the financial
                              instruments offered to customers are in line with their risk awareness.
                              </p>
<p>As part of this process, Compliance issues advance opinions on the transactions
                              considered
                              as sensitive, and will subsequently check that the these opinions have been observed.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Compliance pays particular attention to the commercial margins on

                              its customers' expectations, and therefore to better gauge the quality of the customer
                              relationship. Interviews have been conducted to find out if our products and services
                              fully meet our customers' expectations, to assess the quality of our organisation,

                              tax

                              </p>
<p>As part of its global strategy, following assistance of its customers on compliance
                              with their tax duties under the Automatic Exchange of Information set up within the
                              European Union, the Wealth Management business line extended the scope of this initiative
                              to the countries who had adopted exchange agreements.
                              </p>
<p>The standard requires financial institutions based in countries that have adopted
                              the standard to identify account holders who are tax residents of a country with which
                              an information exchange agreement has been entered into, and to report information
                              annually (contact information of the account holder, account balances, income received)
                              to their country's tax authorities.
                              </p>
<p>The Indosuez Wealth Management Group has a basic rule of only working with customers
                              who meet their tax obligations. Wealth Management therefore intends to base itself
                              primarily on the systems in place in the different countries (the Automatic Information
                              Exchange systems in particular) to deal with the issue of customer Tax Compliance
                              (booking centres available to AIE countries, selection of customers living in these
                              countries).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CSR SECTOR POLICIES
                              AND COAL ELIMINATION</h4>
<p>In the first half of 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB committed to a general policy of
                              pulling
                              back from funding coal-related activities.
                              </p>
<p>The CSR sector policy relating to mining and metals was revised in May 2015 to
                              exclude
                              any financing involving coal mining as well as corporate financing for industrial
                              groups where coal production represents a predominant portion of their business. The
                              application of this new policy resulted in a reduction of over 50% in the Bank's exposure
                              to such counterparties in 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The sector policy relating to coal-fired plants was revised in September 2015 to
                              exclude
                              the financing of new coal-fired plants or their extension in countries that meet the
                              World Bank's definition of high-income countries and in November 2016 to exclude all
                              new projects anywhere in the world. The issue of corporate financing of electricity
                              companies is far more complex, and will be examined on a case-by-case basis, taking
                              account of customers' diversification plans and specific energy mixes.

<p>Since 2011, Crédit Agricole CIB has used a procedure to calculate greenhouse gas
                              emissions
                              said to be financed by a financial institution. The procedure was developed at its
                              request by the Chair in Quantitative Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris
                              Dauphine University and École polytechnique. This innovative P9XCA methodology has,
                              since 2014, been recommended for corporate and investment banks in the financial sector
                              guide to "Conducting a greenhouse gas emissions audit" published by the Agency for
                              Environment and Energy Management, the Observatory on Corporate Social Responsibility
                              and the Bilan Carbone Association. Since 2011, Crédit Agricole CIB has used it to
                              calculate the order of magnitude of the financed emissions, and to map these emissions
                              based on sector and geographic location. It allowed the Bank to identify the sectors
                              for which it needed to develop sectoral CSR policies, with the macro sectors of Energy
                              and Transport accounting for over 80% of the financed emissions. It was also used
                              in 2015 to select the industrial sectors and countries with the highest carbon components
                              in their financing (tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per euro financed). For these
                              countries it was decided to introduce a
                              specific analysis of climate-related factors.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB conducted an exercise to map climate risks based on
                              the
                              typology information it now had (physical, transition and legal risks), investigating
                              the importance of these risks and whether or not there were factors which could incite
                              the Bank to take action in the short term (before 2020), medium term (2020-2030) and
                              long term (after 2030).
                              </p>
<p>The conclusion drawn from this exercise is that, for corporate and investment banking,
                              the priority appears to be the medium term transition risks, given their anticipated
                              significance and the availability of potential solution to control them.
                              </p>
<p>For financial players, this risk arises mainly from the uncertain return from their
                              customers' investments and changes in the financial models which result from the changes
                              in the economic environment brought about by initiatives against global warming (introduction
                              of a carbon price, regulatory changes).
                              </p>
<p>Work began to improve the assessment of the medium-term transition risks to make
                              them
                              easier to manage. In 2016, work began to develop a procedure to help assess changes
                              in the quality of the Bank's individual counterparts resulting from the energy transition
                              which was expected to take place by 2020-2030.
                              </p>
<p>A study by the Agency for Environment and Energy Management (Agence De l'Environnement
                              et de la Maîtrise de l'Énergie - ADEME) published in 2016 ("100% renewable electricity
                              mix Technical overview and summary macroeconomic assessment") concluded that the transition
                              towards a 100% renewable energy mix would impact positively on the key macroeconomic
                              indicators (GDP, employment, households' disposable income, etc.) in France. It would
                              seem, therefore, that the medium-term impact of the energy transition will not necessarily
                              be negative for economic actors. Rather, it will be important to be able to identify
                              the winners and the losers in this major change. Crédit Agricole CIB decided to focus
                              on differences rather than adopt a sector average approach and to assign a zero impact
                              to a customer in the average range.
                              </p>
<p>The potential impact of the energy transition on a customer's financial results
                              appeared
                              to depend on two main factors:

                              </p>
</td>

</table>
<p>For each customer group, the transition risk index is calculated by adding together
                              these three factors. The index is positive when the counterparty demonstrates above-average
                              preparedness and is negative if it does not. The more the customer stands out from
                              its peers, the more the sector is considered to be at risk, and the more the country
                              has committed to a rapid energy transition, the higher the absolute value of the index.
                              </p>
<p>Thus, a player in the Energy or Transport sectors in a country committed to significantly
                              lowering emissions will have more to gain or lose than a player in a sector which
                              is less affected in a country with lower greenhouse gas reduction demands. The extent
                              to which this actor is affected will depend on its ability to adapt its strategy and
                              economic model to the new situation.

                              SMART CLIMATE OBJECTIVES</h4>
<p>Financing the energy transition represents a major societal challenge, as highlighted
                              in the latest assessment report by the Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC).
                              The IPCC estimates the volume of climate-related financing at approximately USD 350
                              billion per year, with most of this amount targeting mitigation measures. The private
                              sector accounts for approximately two thirds of the total financing.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB actively contributes to meeting this objective:</p>

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ PROJECT FINANCE</h4>
<p>Financing renewable energies is an integral part of Crédit Agricole CIB's strategy,
                              and the Bank is a leading provider of such project financing. The Bank first entered
                              this sector in 1997 by financing the first wind farms, and in 2008 it financed a solar
                              energy project in Spain. The Project Finance business line has financed a total of
                              359 wind farms generating more than 18,500 MW and 100 solar farms representing more
                              than 3,000 MW in installed capacity. In terms of number of loans, renewable energy
                              represented over 75% of electricity generation project finance in 2016. The rapid
                              increase in the number of projects and financial capacity can, to a certain extent,
                              be explained by the portfolio financing of existing facilities.

                              AND SUSTAINABILITY BONDS</h4>
<p>Green bonds can play a prominent role in steering bond markets toward financing
                              initiatives
                              that help fight climate change. In addition, social and environmental bonds, also
                              known as Social and Sustainability Bonds, create a link between market products and
                              the infrastructures needed to build a more equitable society. They also provide investors
                              with specific indicators on the financed projects as well as their social impacts
                              and environmental benefits. A growing number of investor clients value this information
                              and the additional commitment by issuers.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">3.4 IMPROVE CLIMATE-RELATED
                              RESULTS</h4>
<p>Since 2011, in addition to the standard greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations shown
                              in
                              the "Limiting our direct environmental footprint" section, an estimation of the Bank's
                              financing and investment carbon footprint is now in place. This is obtained using
                              the P9XCA methodology. The recorded order of magnitude was the equivalent of 100 Mt
                              of C02. This induced footprint, approximately 1,000 times greater than the estimated
                              operating emissions for Crédit Agricole CIB, reflects the carbon intensity of the
                              financed activities and demonstrates the Bank's active role in financing the global
                              economy.
                              </p>
<p>The CSR sector policies developed for the sectors with the most formidable challenges
                              in terms of the quantity of financed emissions have guided Crédit Agricole CIB's funding
                              decisions in these sensitive sectors, and their purpose is therefore to improve the
                              Bank's induced climate performances (see box: CSR sector policies and coal elimination).
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">3.5 REPORT ON
                              CLIMATE ACTION</h4>
<p>Financial institutions, particularly in the private sector, are faced with a major
                              dilemma regarding the disclosure of their actions. On the one hand, they are bound
                              by a duty of confidentiality towards their customers, and on the other, public interest
                              groups continue to demand greater transparency and comparability. Other major hindrances
                              to accurate reporting of actions performed are the large numbers of customers and
                              transactions, the low relevance of international economic classifications to climate
                              issues and the wide range of bank loans.
                              </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Crédit Agricole CIB has made every effort to boost transparency,
                              by
                              publishing its environmental and social assessment and elimination criteria in its
                              CSR sector policies.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also encourages transparency from its customers, with a focus
                              on the Equator Principles which require customers to disclose certain information.
                              This is also true of the Green Bond Principles, which aim to increase transparency
                              on the market by encouraging issuers to regularly publish their reporting on fund
                              allocation and on environmental and social impact measures for financed projects.
                              </p>
<p>Based on these reports published by issuers and on publicly-available transaction
                              information, Crédit Agricole CIB analyses all of its projects financed by the green,
                              sustainability and social bonds. It was concluded on the basis of these analyses that
                              at the end of 2016, 93% of bonds present on the green, sustainability and social bond
                              market (representing a total outstanding amount of USD 190 billion) were financing
                              projects with an environmental purpose. The breakdown by sector for these environmental
                              projects is as follows:

    " src="contentloader?publicationdata.pubcode=RegistrationDocumentCrditAgricoleCIB2016Pic4.jpg;15279951&amp;state.action=db"/></div>
<p>Renewable energy and energy efficiency represent the vast majority of the projects
                              financed by green and sustainability bonds, which are themselves broken down as shown
                              below:

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ CONCEPT - DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>In 2013, Crédit Agricole CIB developed a new product: the "Crédit Agricole CIB
                              Green
                              Notes". The Green Notes are bonds or any other financial instrument issued by Crédit
                              Agricole CIB whose funds raised are dedicated to funding environmental projects.
                              </p>
<p>For its Green Notes, Crédit Agricole CIB has followed the principles laid down
                              by
                              the Green Bond Principles which are voluntary principles for the formulation of green
                              bonds and for market guidance. Green Bond Principles are offered by the major green
                              bonds arranging banks, including Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's Green Notes are presented based on four structuring lines,

<p>In April 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB sought a second opinion from the non-financial
                              rating agency Sustainalytics on the issue of green notes. Sustainalytics experts approved
                              the methods used to select the projects to be included in the Green portfolio, as
                              well as the relevance of the chosen sectors to climate change prevention.

                              conviction that the transition to a greener economy will involve numerous industrial
                              sectors, around the world.

                              CUSTOMERS ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS</h4>
<p>Since 2010, our Sustainable Banking team has been helping customers pursue social
                              and environmental projects related to four areas of excellence selected by the Crédit
                              Agricole Group, namely: farming and food production, housing, health and the ageing
                              population, and the energy and environment economy.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB helped a customer set up an investment fund dedicated to developing
                              renewable energy infrastructures in emerging countries. This investment fund generates
                              a medium to long term return by encouraging private investors to support a portfolio
                              of renewable energy development projects and offers different investment tranches
                              with varying risk/return profiles. Crédit Agricole CIB was involved in all stages
                              of the project, from design to putting investors into contact with the project owners.
                              As access to energy facilitates economic activity and improves living conditions,
                              this project has a positive impact on the economic development of the regions involved.

                              SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT (SRI) IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT</h4>
<p>Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) seeks to reconcile an investment's economic
                              performance with its social and environmental impact by providing financing to companies
                              and public-sector entities that contribute to sustainable development, regardless
                              of the economic sector. By influencing the governance and behaviour of market participants,
                              SRI promotes a responsible economy.
                              </p>
<p>This responsible development concept has been extended to product marketing and
                              social
                              policy.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, CA Indosuez Wealth Group put together an action plan which included the
                              following

                              AND MANAGING THE RISKS ARISING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
                              OF OUR FINANCING
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has developed a system to assess and manage the risks arising
                              from the environmental and social impacts relating to both transactions and customers,
                              by factoring in the main sustainable development issues i.e. combating global warming,
                              biodiversity protection and the protection of human rights.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ FACTORING IN
                              SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; GLOBAL WARMING</h4>
<p>Refer to section 3: "Incorporating global warming issues" for details of how this
                              issue is factored in.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; BIODIVERSITY
                              PROTECTION (INDICATOR 2E)</h4>
<p>Since it exercises a services activity and is located in urban environments, the
                              Bank
                              does not have a significant direct impact on biodiversity.
                              </p>
<p>However, the activities it finances may in some cases affect biodiversity. In its
                              CSR sectoral policies, Crédit Agricole CIB therefore introduced analytical and exclusionary
                              criteria based on biodiversity protection, with particular attention paid to important
                              areas based on this criterion. Critical adverse impacts on the most sensitive protected
                              areas, such as and wetlands covered by the Ramsar Convention, constitute exclusionary
                              criteria under these policies, for example.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB mapped the sectors and geographical regions which
                              were
                              most exposed to water access and pollution issues. For the customers operating in
                              these sectors and geographical regions, their water saving and pollution prevention
                              policies were analysed.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; OTHER ACTIONS
                              IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (INDICATOR 3E)</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB fully adheres to the values of the United Nations Global Compact,
                              which has been signed by Crédit Agricole, and relates primarily to human rights and
                              labour standards. Crédit Agricole S.A. has signed several specific charters in addition
                              to these general principles, including the Diversity Charter in 2008, the Human Rights
                              Charter in 2009 and the Responsible Purchasing Charter in 2010.
                              </p>
<p>Employee-related actions are detailed in the section "Developing people and the
                              societal
                              ecosystem" while actions linked to subcontractors and suppliers are covered in the
                              section on "Strengthening trust".
                              </p>
<p>As with climate and biodiversity matters, however, the indirect impacts involving
                              the financed activities appear as most significant. They are assessed and managed
                              as shown below. The Bank's CSR sector policies refer specifically to the International
                              Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental conventions, and the International Finance Corporation
                              (IFC) performance standards.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB mapped the sectors and geographical regions which
                              were
                              most exposed to risks of human rights violations. For the customers operating in these
                              sectors and geographical regions, their policies to prevent the violation of human
                              rights, both in their own activities and their supply chain, were analysed.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB continued to take part in the financial sector debate
                              about how the communities negatively impacted by projects financed by the commercial
                              banks could access the banks involved in this financing.

<p>The environmental and social impacts resulting from the financing activity appear
                              to be substantially greater than the Bank's direct environmental footprint. Taking
                              these indirect impacts into account is one of the main sustainable development challenges
                              for Crédit Agricole CIB. The system which manages these environmental and social business
                              risks is based on three pillars:

<p>From 2013, Crédit Agricole CIB also introduced a scoring system for all its corporate

<p>Environmental and social risks are first assessed and managed by the account manager.
                              Account managers are backed by a network of local correspondents, who provide the
                              necessary support in each regional Project Finance structuring centre and remain in
                              constant communication with a co-ordination unit. It comprises operating staff from
                              the Project Finance business line and co-ordinates the practical aspects of the implementation
                              of the Equator Principles. It manages the network of local correspondents and implements
                              specialised training for participants.
                              </p>
<p>Group Economic Research (ECO) is an integral part of Crédit Agricole S.A. and provides
                              additional support and clarification for all types of transactions and customers by
                              contributing its expertise on environmental and technical issues, thereby making it
                              possible to fine-tune the analysis and identify the risks for each business sector.
                              </p>
<p>Even though its corporate client base comprises mostly SMEs, Wealth Management
                              integrates
                              environmental and social components into its risk analysis based on the sector policies
                              defined by Crédit Agricole CIB and the Group. The compliance risk grid for credit
                              transactions covers these issues, supported by a special opinion if necessary.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ THE EQUATOR
                              PRINCIPLES</h4>
<p>The Equator Principles were developed in response to limitations and triggers related
                              to project financing, as defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Although
                              they cannot always be applied in their current state to other types of financing,
                              they nevertheless represent a useful methodological framework for recognising and
                              preventing environmental and social impacts in cases where the financing appears to
                              be linked to the construction of a specific industrial asset (plant, transport infrastructure,
                              etc.).
                              </p>
<p>The implementation of the Equator Principles is described in detail on the Bank's
                              website.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ CSR SECTOR
                              POLICIES</h4>
<p>The CSR sector policies published by Crédit Agricole CIB explain the social and
                              environmental
                              criteria included in its financing policies. These criteria relate mainly to the issues
                              of concern to civil society that appear to be the most relevant for a corporate and
                              investment bank, particularly those relating to human rights, fighting global warming
                              and preserving biodiversity. The goal of the CSR sector policies is therefore to clarify
                              the non-financial principles and rules relating to financing and investments in the
                              corresponding sectors, in accordance with the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group policy.
                              </p>
<p>The current sector policies and their implementation are described on the website.</p>

                              ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has been assessing the environmental and social impacts of
                              transactions
                              since 2009. They reflect either questions on managing environmental or social impacts
                              that are deemed critical, or controversy related to transactions or customers.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ CUSTOMER CSR
                              SCORING</h4>
<p>From 2013, Crédit Agricole CIB introduced a CSR scoring system for all corporate
                              clients
                              designed to complement its system for assessing and managing the environmental and
                              social risks of transactions. Clients are rated each year on a scale that includes
                              three levels (Advanced, Compliance and Sensitive), with these ratings based on:
                              </p>
<table cellpadding="0mm" class="list_table_ul">

                              rating).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This scoring system will evolve following the service contract signed with a non-financial
                              rating agency. The tests carried out in 2016 on the use of this agency's ratings make
                              it possible to consider changing the CSR scoring system using three levels of due
                              diligence: reduced, standard and higher. These three levels of due diligence are described
                              on the Bank's website.

                              AND PROMOTING EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYABILITY</h4>
<p>The human resources policy of the Group and Crédit Agricole CIB is to ensure that
                              each position in the organisation is held by a motivated employee whose skills and
                              performance meet the requirements and challenges of his or her position, but also
                              to prepare for the future. Thus, Crédit Agricole CIB deploys a policy of career management
                              to enable each employee, regardless of its level in the organisation, to expand its
                              professional experience in a constructive manner, but also to develop skills that
                              will be necessary in the future.
                              </p>
<p>This approach is harmonised and globally shared to reflect the international nature
                              of Crédit Agricole CIB's operations and its corporate culture.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ EMPLOYEE INDUCTION
                              AND INTEGRATION</h4>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB rolled out its CACIB Global Induction Programme, to
                              help
                              new employees integrate into the Company. The programme introduces them to the different
                              Crédit Agricole CIB business lines and the Bank's culture.
                              </p>
<p>There is a special area in the Crédit Agricole CIB intranet which lists a large
                              number
                              of documents which will help them integrate. Digital resources are also available
                              on the Bank's international training portal, HRE-Learning. An individual programme
                              of mandatory training courses is in place to develop and promote the compliance and
                              risks culture, helping new employees to adopt the correct conduct expected of them
                              in regulatory matters. This step is vital to limit the Bank's risk exposure. Depending
                              on the business line, new employees may also follow additional training courses linked
                              to their activity. Optional modules are also available on the portal to help them
                              successfully take up their new position.
                              </p>
<p>During their first year within the Bank, new arrivals are also invited to take
                              part
                              in an induction event to gain a better understanding of the interaction between the
                              Bank's different business lines and to meet their peers who have recently joined Crédit
                              Agricole CIB teams. On 13 October 2016, 240 employees attended the first of these
                              new format events in France. It is planned to roll them out worldwide in 2017.

<p>Each year, the appraisal and objectives meetings provide an opportunity to take
                              stock
                              of individual and collective performance and the employees' achievements and development
                              needs.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB offered all of its employees in France and abroad
                              a digital
                              course to help them prepare for the appraisal and objectives meeting on its international
                              training portal, HRE-Learning. The course offers content in various formats: interactive
                              modules, videos and memo cards.
                              </p>
<p>Within the framework of this worldwide campaign in 2016, 99% of the annual assessments
                              between employees and managers have been realised.
                              </p>

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB employs an active training policy to meet its current and future
                              strategic challenges. The Bank encourages all employees to continuously adapt their
                              skills to the fast and complex changes in the economic, regulatory and technological
                              environment.
                              </p>
<p>A new worldwide training portal, HRE-learning, was launched in 2016. Employees
                              have
                              access to this portal throughout the year. It provides them with an overview of all
                              training that is currently available and free access to digital courses in the areas
                              of banking, finance and personal development. Structured into academic, business line
                              and cross-functional courses, it offers a veritable plethora of opportunities which
                              encourages employees to take control of their training. This digital training, focusing
                              on vital business skills and the knowledge expected of employees, is offered in addition
                              to the classroom sessions also offered.
                              </p>

<p>This year again, the percentage of Crédit Agricole CIB's training expenditure relative

                              </p>
<p>In France, Crédit Agricole CIB spent €10.8 million on training in 2016 (including
                              €4 million paid to the fund collecting agency). In France, more than 76% of employees
                              with permanent employment contracts had been trained at the end of November 2016 (estimated
                              after 11 months of the year, see workforce statistics). Employees trained in 2016
                              received an average 26 hours training.

<p>This year, the figures included the SYFADIS training (specifically the regulatory
                              modules). Based on the same scope as last year, we would have: 2,895 employees trained
                              (including work-study contracts, which were not included last year) in France.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; ENCOURAGING
                              INTERNAL MOBILITY TO ENHANCE CAREER PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYEES</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB encourages internal mobility to allow all of its employees
                              to
                              progress within the Bank and the Crédit Agricole Group. Internal mobility is favoured
                              over external recruitment.
                              </p>
<p>MyJobs is a dedicated internal mobility portal which is available to Crédit Agricole
                              CIB in France and worldwide. It lists all of the job vacancies in corporate and investment
                              banking and the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group. Crédit Agricole CIB uses different tools
                              to support employee mobility: mobility committees, business line forums, HR interviews,
                              CV workshops and speed interviews. These tools and initiatives create a more cross-disciplinary
                              approach and develop the mobility culture.
                              </p>
<p>The "En route pour la mobilité" [Towards mobility] leaflet was distributed to employees
                              attending the third edition of the business lines forums, the "Forum des Métiers"
                              [Business Forum], on 13 October 2016 in France. This leaflet contains practical tips
                              to help them prepare for a successful move within the Company and an overview of the
                              support structures in place.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; IDENTIFYING
                              AND DEVELOPING TALENTS</h4>
<p>At Crédit Agricole CIB, the members of the Management Committee, managers and Human
                              Resources have been working to identify and manage talent for several years now. Part
                              of the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group policy, it aims to retain and develop the capabilities
                              of employees with potential and to ensure succession plans for strategic positions
                              at the Bank.
                              </p>
<p>Since 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB's Talent Management policy has been structured
                              around
                              three categories based on identification criteria approved by Executive Management:
                              Rising Talents, Advanced Talents and Future Leaders. Each year, the executive committees
                              of the business lines work with Human Resources to review the talent lists worldwide.
                              Diversity is a particularly important factor in this review.
                              </p>
<p>The Bank's talents are offered special development opportunities which combine
                              Group-wide
                              programmes and specific Crédit Agricole CIB programmes.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, 30 Rising Talents took part in the third My Way programme in France and
                              worldwide.
                              This programme brings together the employee, his or her manager and HR manager to
                              discuss the employee's development plan and career path.
                              </p>
<p>Indosuez Wealth Management also offers the My Way programme to employees from its
                              different sites. Alongside the programme, its Rising Talents are also invited to work
                              on cross-functional projects and meet executives.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB added to the range of programmes it offers its talents in 2016
                              with the roll out of a leadership programme for European talents and workshops on
                              inter-cultural challenges. Initiatives to further promote gender equality at the Bank
                              were also stepped up this year.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ PROMOTING AND
                              MANAGING EMPLOYEES WITH RESPECT AND RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
<p>In a complex and constantly-changing environment, it is vital that the Crédit Agricole
                              CIB strategy it properly disseminated. The managers play a key role in implementing
                              the strategy at all levels of the Bank, mobilising the teams and developing the skills
                              of their employees. Since 2012, Crédit Agricole CIB has therefore deployed the Management
                              Academy, a training programme for all managers in France and worldwide, which aims
                              to develop a shared managerial culture. The programme offers digital and classroom
                              training modules for four skill sets: leadership, management, change management and
                              personal development.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the management training module was expanded and Level 1 of the Management
                              Academy was opened up to all employees in France and worldwide. Employees have free
                              access to digital modules on managerial topics via the Bank's international training
                              portal.
                              </p>
<p>Indosuez Wealth Management, for its part, worked to develop its managerial culture
                              in 2016 in order to promote internally its new positioning and single brand. Through
                              IndosuezManagementWay, an initiative run jointly with the ESSEC Business School, managers
                              took part in conferences, workshops and training courses to help them develop a managerial
                              mindset and adopt good work practices. The Panorama 2016 seminar offered 50 managers
                              an occasion to discuss the Indosuez Wealth Management strategy and identify development
                              opportunities.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PRIORITY 2: GUARANTEEING
                              EQUALITY AND PROMOTING DIVERSITY</h4>
<p>As a committed and responsible employer, Crédit Agricole CIB wants its organisation
                              to reflect the rich diversity of society and therefore makes every effort to treat
                              every employee fairly.
                              </p>
<p>To ensure its employees are properly equipped to understand diversity issues, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB set up a Diversity Academy, open to all in France and worldwide, on its
                              HRE-Learning training portal. The Diversity Academy develops employees' openness,
                              listening skills, self-awareness and awareness of others through digital modules on
                              topics such as interculturality, gender and disability.
                              </p>
<p>Alongside this, Crédit Agricole CIB organises conferences and workshops to foster
                              the international culture and multicultural skills of the employees in its different
                              sites.

<p>Convinced that diversity is the key to promoting performance and innovation, for
                              several
                              years now Crédit Agricole CIB executives have been following a proactive diversity
                              policy. As part of this policy, the Bank's Management Committee met in July 2016 for
                              an extraordinary seminar to discuss diversity and performance at Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              During the seminar, the managers worked on the diversity action plans to be implemented
                              in 2017.
                              </p>
<p>In order to identify the key issues and measure the effectiveness of its diversity
                              policy, Crédit Agricole CIB monitors gender distribution indicators throughout the
                              year. These indicators are shared with employees, particularly during Diversity Week.
                              At the annual Diversity Week, which is held in France and worldwide, employees take
                              part in educational conferences and awareness workshops. The 2016 addition saw initiatives
                              proposed in Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Dubai, London, Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also runs two leadership programmes for its female employees.
                              During the leadership training for female employees and at the Eve seminar, employees
                              meet up with participants from other major groups in order to share their experiences.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also supports gender equality networks which have been set
                              up
                              at its different sites by female employees, such as CWEEN, launched in India in 2008,
                              Potentielles in France in 2010, SPRING in London in 2015 and RISE in Hong Kong in
                              2016.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016 in France, Crédit Agricole CIB and all of the unions signed a second three-year
                              agreement on gender equality at work. Building on the previous agreement, this agreement
                              continues to pursue the following key commitments:

<p>After a maternity leave study in 2015 in France, action plans were introduced in
                              2016
                              on the topics of information, organisation, replacement and support for female employees.
                              </p>
<p>A maternity and paternity kit, which includes a managers memo, was distributed
                              to
                              all employees. Crédit Agricole CIB will work in 2017 to adapt this kit for its international
                              sites. Also in France in 2016, 29 female employees who had recently returned from
                              maternity leave took part in pilot workshops to help them combine their career with
                              motherhood.

                              FIND A BETTER WORK/LIFE BALANCE</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's planned move took place in France in 2016 as part of the
                              Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. Group's plan to merge its subsidiaries at the Evergreen site in Montrouge
                              and the SQY Park at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.
                              </p>
<p>To help its employees find a good work/life balance following the move the Bank
                              provided
                              support measures, such as moving grants, travel grants and new work organisation options,
                              mainly through a number of collective agreements.
                              </p>
<p>Thanks to the teleworking agreement signed in France on 17 December 2015, Crédit
                              Agricole
                              CIB was able to offer this new working practice in 2016. As a result, at 31 December
                              2016, almost 500 employees were working from home for one day a week, even two days
                              in some cases.
                              </p>
<p>Flexible working arrangements were also introduced in other European countries
                              in
                              which Crédit Agricole CIB operates. A more global rollout of this initiative is also
                              being examined.
                              </p>
<p>Teleworking was also tested at Indosuez Wealth Management in France in 2016.</p>
<p>As part of its policy to promote gender equality, Crédit Agricole CIB is also running
                              parenting initiatives in France and worldwide.
                              </p>
<p>On 26 November 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB organised a family day at its two Paris
                              sites
                              in collaboration with the Group. For the Bank, the event, which was open to all employees
                              and their families, marked the end of its move.
                              </p>
<p>In France, Crédit Agricole CIB also provides, for its employees in and outside
                              the
                              Paris region, 31 places in intercompany nurseries (through a partnership with the
                              Babilou nationwide nurseries network), which are allocated based on social criteria.
                              Parents (fathers or mothers) may also receive authorised paid leave on the first day
                              of school in order to accompany their children.

                              numerous activities promoting the diversity of the recruited profiles. On 25 May 2016,
                              the Bank joined up with the Mozaïk RH Association, a top recruitment and human resources
                              consultancy specialising in promoting diversity, to run a speed recruiting session

                              INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES IN FRANCE AND WORLDWIDE</h4>
<p>The Bank ensures a strong presence in schools and universities, particularly through
                              the Group-run "School Captains" programme. This is a network of some 60 Crédit Agricole
                              CIB employees who promote the Company and the Group at their alma maters.
                              </p>
<p>Many managers and employees join HR teams at school and university forums in France
                              and abroad to share their experience with students and receive applications for the
                              various positions to be filled. In 2016, the Bank significantly enhanced its employer
                              brand abroad by stepping up its presence at schools and universities in Europe, Asia
                              and the United States. Crédit Agricole CIB took part in some 50 student forums this
                              year, around a dozen of which took place abroad.
                              </p>
<p>In France and worldwide, the Bank is setting up educational partnerships (case
                              studies,
                              courses, conferences, presentation of our business lines and trading room visits).
                              In 2016, new partnerships were signed with Paris Dauphine University and the Centrale/Supelec
                              engineering school in Paris. Crédit Agricole CIB continued its efforts to support
                              the financial associations of engineering and business schools as well as universities,

                              AND INTEGRATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</h4>
<p>Since 2005, Crédit Agricole S.A. Group in France has been actively promoting the
                              employment
                              of people with disabilities through job retention and awareness initiatives and also
                              through recruitment from the sheltered and disability-friendly sectors. The fourth
                              agreement, signed in 2014, is a logical continuation of the efforts made over the
                              previous ten years and covers all of the Group entities.
                              </p>
<p>To help retain employees with disabilities, Crédit Agricole CIB plans to adjust
                              workstations
                              and the working environment: ergonomics studies, specially adapted computer equipment
                              (screens, special software for employees with visual impairment), use of the Tadéo
                              telephone aid for deaf employees, introduction of working from home and developing
                              the use of sign language translation for conferences and training courses. This individual
                              support can also take the form of tailored training, psychological monitoring, or
                              coaching.
                              </p>
<p>Preventative health and disability awareness events are organised throughout the
                              year
                              to inform employees about the different illnesses and to offer better support for
                              disabled employees. The Disability Employment Week was held at the Bank's offices
                              from 14 to 18 November 2016. This year's theme was "Tous handicapés par nos stéréotypes"
                              [Stereotypes are a handicap for all].
                              </p>
<p>In addition to its direct initiatives to raise awareness about the employment of
                              people
                              with disabilities, Crédit Agricole CIB delegates services to the sheltered and disability-friendly

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ A COMPENSATION
                              POLICY BASED ON EQUALITY </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h4>
<p>In keeping with the specific nature of its business lines and legal entities and
                              the
                              laws of the respective countries, the Crédit Agricole Group strives to develop a system
                              of compensation that provides employees with fair, incentivising and competitive pay
                              in respect of its reference markets, while promoting sound and risk-aware management.
                              </p>
<p>This compensation policy seeks to reward both individual and group performance,
                              in
                              accordance with the values of fairness and merit that characterise the Group. The
                              base salary compensates skills and responsibility levels in accordance with the specific
                              nature of each business line and market levels, and based on the principle of equal
                              treatment among employees. At Crédit Agricole CIB, variable compensation plans related
                              to individual and group performance are established based on the achievement of set
                              targets, the entity's profits and the factoring of risks.
                              </p>
<p>Variable compensation packages are established according to the business line performance
                              by taking into account the risk profile of the business lines and all of the costs,
                              including the cost of risks, liquidity and return on equity. Individual awards to
                              employees are made in accordance with a management policy according to an overall
                              assessment of their performance, in line with financial and non-financial objectives
                              as well as their knowledge of and compliance with internal operating rules.
                              </p>
<p>A compensation management tool was created at Indosuez Wealth Management in 2016.
                              It aims to facilitate the decision-making process by offering managers access to a
                              wealth of online compensation-related information such as a history, evaluation scores
                              and identification data. A procedure was also put in place to ensure that the global
                              policy was applied at local level. One of the measures was to set up a central committee
                              and local committees to ensure that arbitration related to compensation, variable
                              compensation in particular, does not encourage dangerous behaviours.

<p>The Bank contributes to the funding of health cover programmes in many countries
                              in
                              order to offer its employees access to healthcare. Crédit Agricole CIB also places
                              significant importance on protecting the families of employees who die or are absent
                              from work, and fully-funds the appropriate schemes for all of its employees worldwide.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB was a forerunner for retirement planning in many countries
                              with
                              its employer-assisted savings plan which has been in place in France, Spain, Italy,
                              the United Kingdom and the United States for over 20 years.
                              </p>
<p>Through its employee savings schemes, employees share in the Company's results
                              and
                              performance. Since 2016, the profit-sharing agreement in France has incorporated the
                              Bank's CSR indicator, FReD, to take account of the joint commitment of the Company
                              and its employees to the success of the CSR policy. Worldwide, employees are regularly
                              offered the opportunity to share in capital increase operations. In 2016, this applied
                              to ten countries in which Crédit Agricole CIB operates.
                              </p>
<p>Employees on international postings are granted special company benefits appropriate
                              for the particular country of origin/host country combination.

                              THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE WORKPLACE </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; PROVIDING
                              EMPLOYEES WITH A WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS THAT ENSURE
                              THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY
                              </h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB considers quality of life in the workplace as a driver of fulfilment
                              and performance and as being essential to its effectiveness. The Bank provides employees
                              in France and abroad with training in the preventing of stress, including on its HRE-Learning
                              portal at the Management Academy and Diversity Academy. In France, any courses in
                              this area requested during appraisal sessions or at other times of the year by employees
                              and managers are systematically approved. In 2016, 48 employees took the course "Balancing
                              pressure and effectiveness".
                              </p>
<p>As part of the agreement for the prevention of stress in the workplace at Crédit
                              Agricole
                              CIB, which was signed on 2 July 2013 in France, the observatory "Preventing psychosocial
                              risks" was set up. This ongoing tool for measuring stress makes it possible, at regular
                              intervals, to identify the sources of stress and the most vulnerable groups of employees.
                              To that end, Bank employees are asked by the workplace health department to complete
                              an online survey when they have their medical check-up every other year. Three years
                              after implementation, 71% of employees in France have replied to the survey. The results
                              are submitted annually to the Psychosocial Risks Committee.
                              </p>
<p>To fight against psychosocial risks, Crédit Agricole CIB provides an anonymous
                              and
                              confidential psychological support service to employees in France with a toll-free
                              number.
                              </p>
<p>The employees can also share any observations they have with the Human Resources
                              Department,
                              including their own HR manager. As part of the efforts to prevent psychosocial risks,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB encourages all those concerned within the Company to play an active
                              role and report any difficulties that might be encountered by employees (senior management,
                              managers, workplace health unit, social workers, human resources, employee representatives
                              and employees).
                              </p>
<p>Throughout the year, Crédit Agricole CIB also holds events on the issue of health
                              at its various sites: medical check-ups, training in first aid and the use of a defibrillator,
                              free-of-charge screening, vaccination campaigns, blood donations, advice on ergonomics,
                              nutrition workshops and relaxation sessions.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PRIORITY 4: PROMOTING
                              EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE</h4>
<p>The Group promotes dynamic and constructive social dialogue with its employees
                              and
                              their representatives. This commitment can take several different forms: direct discussions,
                              social surveys and questionnaires, the use of collaborative tools and organising high
                              quality social dialogue.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; MAINTAINING
                              AN ACTIVE SOCIAL DIALOGUE WITH EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES</h4>
<p>Social dialogue is a reflection of corporate responsibility. The Group pays attention
                              to the development of a constructive social dialogue with a view to conclude structured
                              agreements which carries true commitments.
                              </p>
<p>In France, social dialogue is organised through elected or appointed employee representatives:
                              the works council, employee delegates, the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee
                              and union representatives.
                              </p>
<p>2016 provided an opportunity to update and rethink the way that social dialogue
                              was
                              organised as part of the roll-out of the Rebsamen Law.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, in support of the collective Crédit Agricole CIB office move, the
                              number
                              of meetings with the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee were increased,
                              further testimony to a desire for a true exchange of ideas with this body concerning
                              the review of employee working conditions. Eight extraordinary meetings were held
                              in addition to the compulsory ordinary meetings that take place every year. An agreement
                              was also reached to prolong the terms of office of the members of the Health, Safety
                              and Working Conditions Committee, in order to ensure the quality and continuity of
                              the work undertaken with this body as part of the Crédit Agricole CIB office move.
                              </p>
<p>Social dialogue is also very much a part of the negotiations conducted with the
                              unions
                              represented within the Bank for the purpose of establishing collective agreements
                              on behalf of all stakeholders. In this way, in 2016 in France, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              entered into six collective agreements signed without exception by all of the unions
                              represented within the Company. Four of these agreements covered employee compensation
                              and benefits (company savings scheme, collective retirement savings plan, and profit
                              sharing scheme).
                              </p>
<p>In order to make our commitment to gender equality in the workplace a reality,
                              a second
                              collective agreement was signed in October 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also accepted all of the requests made by employees and unions
                              for training leave for economic and social training and union training, which represented
                              99 days in 2016.

                              AND SHARING INFORMATION WITH EMPLOYEES TO ENABLE DEBATE AND ENDORSEMENT </h4>
<p>Conference calls and management meetings are held regularly in France and simultaneously
                              broadcast abroad to enable managers to meet the members of Crédit Agricole CIB's Executive
                              Management. Some 925 executives are invited to these meetings and conference calls,
                              which are organised for every quarterly publication of results and throughout the
                              year for strategic topics. Participants are invited to ask questions in advance on
                              an anonymous basis, and Executive Management then answers them during its presentations.
                              </p>
<p>A dedicated space, the "Managers' corner", on the InsideLive global intranet also
                              enables managers to find all of the information that they need to convey to their
                              teams.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, conferences called "InsideMeetings" are regularly held for all employees
                              in France and cover a wide range of topics: strategy, latest news, company culture,
                              corporate partnership, the challenges of sustainable development, etc. These events
                              are an opportunity to find out more and to share information during the question-and-answer
                              sessions at the end of the presentations.
                              </p>
<p>▶︎ ENCOURAGING SCHEMES TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND SELF-EXPRESSION BY EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>In parallel to these regular occasions, a number of other activities encouraging
                              the
                              participation of employees were implemented at Crédit Agricole CIB in 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Having deployed their first global commitment survey in 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              and Indosuez Wealth Management took part in the exercise to measure the Crédit Agricole
                              Group Commitment and Recommendation Index, which was sent to all employees around
                              the world between 26 September and 14 October 2016. Crédit Agricole CIB and Indosuez
                              Wealth Management respectively enjoyed response rates of 63% and 65%.
                              </p>
<p>At the end of the commitment survey conducted in 2015, Crédit Agricole CIB deployed
                              in 2016 nine global action plans sponsored by the members of its Executive Committee.
                              These action plans revolve around the following topics: Leadership and Strategy, Culture
                              and Values, Career Development, Image and Competitiveness. As an example, in order
                              to enable employees to better understand the Bank's strategy, informal meetings (breakfasts
                              or lunches) were organised between employees and top management both in France and
                              abroad.
                              </p>
<p>These nine global action plans are rolled out and enriched by local initiatives
                              in
                              certain countries. The results of the Group survey, which will be communicated to
                              employees in early 2017, will complete the arrangements.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's main economic and social impacts on local areas (both positive
                              and negative) are indirect, through its financing activity, and do not come directly
                              from its sites. Its business services do not therefore have a significant impact on
                              neighbouring and local populations.
                              </p>

<p>During regular events or one-off assignments, employees shared some very rewarding
                              moments in the service of the cause of public interest. These experiences, organised
                              in a number of countries where Crédit Agricole CIB operates, give employees opportunities
                              to engage with and help charities to present their projects to other Bank employees.
                              In 2016, the events revolved around various areas of activity: assistance for charities

                              that might potentially benefit. Furniture was donated to Secours Populaire, Emmaüs,
                              "Coup de main" and Fondation des Femmes.

                              (INDICATOR 3B)</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB continues to actively pursue a policy of cultural sponsorship
                              supporting projects that encourage artistic creation, the discovery of cultures of
                              the world and the transmission of cultural heritage.
                              </p>
<p>In Paris, Crédit Agricole CIB sponsored "42nd Street" at the Théâtre du Châtelet,
                              the last production at the theatre before it closed down for building work. At the
                              Jacques Chirac Musée du Quai Branly, the Bank sponsored the accessibility week to
                              help raise awareness of disability. The "Les Arts Florissants" ensemble performed
                              last year in France, the United States, China and Japan, allowing the Bank, which
                              is the sponsor, to invite customers to some very high quality concerts. In Saintes,
                              the Bank sponsored the Youth Orchestra of the Abbaye aux Dames, the "musical city".
                              This programme allows young musicians to benefit from training by prestigious orchestra
                              directors.
                              </p>
<p>In London, the Bank sponsored two well known cultural institutions, the National

                              and the Barbican.
                              </p>
<p>In New York, the Bank renewed its support for some of the great institutions, including

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB ensures a strong presence in schools, particularly through
                              the
                              "School Captains" programme lead by Crédit Agricole S.A. (see social report in the

                              </p>
<p>Since 2006, Crédit Agricole CIB has also been a partner of the Chair of Quantitative
                              Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris Dauphine University and École Polytechnique.
                              This multi-disciplinary project, supported from its inception by Crédit Agricole CIB,
                              is unique in that it brings together specialists in quantitative finance, mathematics
                              and sustainable development. One research area studied by this Chair since 2010 involves
                              the quantification of indirect impacts of the financing and investment activities,
                              notably greenhouse gas emissions induced by the activities of the Bank's clients.
                              A research initiative was launched in 2013 based on this topic, which brings together
                              well-known researchers such as Jean-Michel Lasry, Pierre-Noël Giraud and Jacques Richard.
                              </p>
<p>One of the solid achievements of this research is the P9XCA methodology referred
                              to
                              previously. Crédit Agricole CIB has played an important role in disseminating this
                              work to other financial institutions. Notably, the Bank actively participated in the
                              sector approach recommended by French organisations promoting corporate social responsibility
                              (ORSE, ADEME and ABC). This approach seeks to produce a practical guide listing the
                              methodologies and tools to help the various financial stakeholders (banks, insurance
                              companies, asset managers) assess their direct and indirect GHG emissions.

<p>For CACIB in the Paris area, 2016 will be remembered for the office moves affecting
                              most of its employees; almost all of them left the buildings in Courbevoie to join
                              the campus in Montrouge or the campus in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. These transfers
                              were spread over several months between May and December 2016 and therefore make it
                              difficult to make any comparative assessment between 2015 and 2016. To date, nearly
                              70% of the employees have moved to the campus in Montrouge, where they are split across
                              the three buildings (Éole, Terra, Silvae), with Éole housing almost 3,000 people.
                              The 30% present on the campus in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines are spread over two buildings
                              (Provence, Champagne).

<p>Lastly, Crédit Agricole CIB offset 13,262 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent by

                              dividends received in 2016 in connection with its investment in the Livelihoods Fund.
                              This carbon investment fund provides investors with carbon credits, which have a major
                              social impact and help to promote biodiversity. The Fund also finances large-scale

                              These projects are implemented for and by deprived rural agricultural communities
                              in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The certificates received

                              old equipment that was not included in the move.
                              </p>
<p>A specialised company was hired to take care of the recycling of the computer equipment
                              in strict accordance with the requirements of the most recent legislation. More than
                              20,000 keyboards, mice, telephones, scanners, central units, screens, etc. were grouped
                              together. Depending on its condition, the equipment was either dismantled using sustainable
                              processes or recycled as second hand equipment.
                              </p>
<p>Some of the furniture (cabinets, desks, tables, chairs, desk lamps, etc.) was sold
                              to specialised brokers to go on and enjoy a new lease of life while the rest was given
                              to associations as mentioned in section 6.2.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, 523 tonnes of obsolete or specialised furniture were collected by
                              a recycling
                              business: Valdelia, an eco-enterprise approved by the Ministry for Ecology, Sustainable
                              Development and Energy.
                              </p>
<p>On the campuses in Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, the actions implemented
                              to reduce impacts on the environment were manifold: zero phytosanitary products, recycling
                              of waste (paper and cardboard, cans, plastic, ordinary industrial waste and waste
                              from maintenance), products with eco-labels for indoor cleaning. Concerning the limitation
                              of food waste, which is a new indicator for 2016, activities are undertaken to raise
                              awareness among employees (posters, self-service fruit and vegetables).
                              </p>
<p>On a worldwide scale, data collection on recycling could still be improved. However,
                              actions have been implemented in the various entities of Crédit Agricole CIB, including
                              in Spain and China (recycling of print cartridges, hand dryers in the toilets, recycling
                              of used supplies, etc.).
                              </p>
<p>Some entities, such as Canada, go further still in terms of waste collection by
                              providing
                              containers for glass, plastic and metals. In the branch there, participation in Earth
                              Day helps to collect and recycle used equipment (computer and miscellaneous electronic
                              equipment, telephones, fluorescent tubes and batteries).
                              </p>
<p>The Indosuez Wealth Management Group is also determined to reduce its direct impact
                              on the environment and continues to take actions to raise the awareness of its employees
                              to eco-friendly behaviour and the implementation of resource management activities
                              and recycling (paper, ink cartridges, batteries, computer equipment).
                              </p>
<p>For instance, when replacing all of its employees' mobile phones, CFM Indosuez
                              decided
                              to reduce its impact on the environment and all of the telephones were recycled by
                              an approved centre. The employees were included in this initiative through the collection
                              of any personal telephones they no longer used and these were given a new lease of
                              life by AMADE Mondiale, an association with which CFM Indosuez had already worked
                              by donating 50 computers. Computer equipment and telephones will from now on be systematically
                              recycled by CFM Indosuez Wealth.
                              </p>
<p>Indosuez Wealth Management Geneva has undertaken a review of how to implement a
                              policy
                              and infrastructure for recycling office waste (paper, household waste, glass, plastic,
                              coffee capsules) in the context of its various real estate projects.
                              </p>
<p>Similarly, Indosuez Wealth Management Geneva plans to continue in 2017 with the
                              programme
                              begun in 2016 to prolong the life of office furniture by donating it to charitable
                              associations or bodies in the Geneva region.

<p>NB: concerning the office move for CACIB in the Paris region, a pro rata calculation
                              of the surface areas occupied as a function of the successive waves of moves out and
                              in has been applied. In view of the significant changes to the scope reported on this
                              year as compared to the previous year any analysis of the variances in consumption
                              is meaningless.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; ELECTRICITY</h4>
<p>For the second consecutive year, Crédit Agricole CIB is reporting on the electricity
                              consumption of all Group entities, including the Indosuez Wealth Management entities,
                              the data centres and the ex-Paris region sites. Over a total surface area of 317,000
                              m<sup>2</sup>, electricity consumption was reported on for approximately 313,000 m<sup>2</sup>,
                              constituting a 99% coverage rate.
                              </p>
<p>For CACIB in the Paris region, the buildings in Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
                              consume a 100% "green" electricity, meaning that it is generated by renewable sources
                              of energy. An objective of reducing consumption by 5% per annum has been set for the
                              Terra, Champagne and Provence buildings.
                              </p>
<p>In London, the electricity consumed is also 100% "green". In Spain, the actions
                              taken
                              between 2014 and 2016 have helped to reduce the consumption of electricity by nearly
                              240,000 kWh (replacement of the heating system, less machines in the machine rooms,
                              replacement of neon strips by LED). Finally, Italy is also replacing neon strips by
                              LED.
                              </p>
<p>The Indosuez Wealth Management building in Geneva has replaced and modernised the
                              cold production machine.
                              </p>
<p>Installing this new generation equipment has made it possible to supply the power
                              needed by the new working area, the data centre and the trading rooms. This new machine
                              will also make it possible to recover energy for the production of hot water for sanitary
                              use (showers and hand-wash basins).
                              </p>
<p>Detailed and documented monitoring of energy consumption has been set up in the
                              Indosuez
                              Wealth Management data centres in Switzerland in order to measure the consumption
                              of computer equipment and calculate the output of the equipment and machinery using
                              the benchmark Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) index, still called the energy efficiency
                              indicator. It will be possible, with these PUE measurements, to influence to some
                              extent the choice of computer equipment with an ECO label and to put in place, if
                              necessary, hot and cold corridors to improve the energy efficiency of the data centres.
                              </p>
<p>This approach is also being implemented at Indosuez Wealth Management in Luxembourg.</p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; GAS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB reports on the consumption of gas of all Crédit Agricole CIB
                              Group
                              entities, including those of Indosuez Wealth Management. For CACIB in the Paris region,
                              in view of the significant changes to the scope reported on this year as compared
                              to the previous year, any analysis of the variances in consumption is meaningless.
                              It should be noted that the buildings in Courbevoie consumed very little gas, whereas
                              those in Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines do use gas. An objective of reducing
                              consumption by 5% per annum has been set for the Terra, Champagne and Provence buildings.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; HEAT OR STEAM
                              NETWORKS AND URBAN NETWORK</h4>
<p>This source of heating is mainly used in North America, Russia and Luxembourg.
                              There
                              is not currently enough historical data to make a comparison.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ WATER CONSUMPTION</h4>
<p>Employees regularly receive alerts via the internal messaging system asking them
                              to
                              report any water leaks in order to enable a quick response.
                              </p>
<p>With regard to Crédit Agricole CIB in Paris, the Éole and Terra buildings have
                              a rainwater
                              recovery system and use water-saving machines for cleaning the floors.
                              </p>
<p>The foreign subsidiaries also report on their efforts to manage water consumption
                              using a "reasoned" approach. For example, hydraulic valves and water-flow restrictor
                              taps were fitted at the Madrid and Moscow premises during refurbishment.

                              PLAN</h4>
<p>A Company Travel Plan (CTP) was drawn up in 2009 for the scope of the Paris region
                              operations (before the office move). This five-year plan included a section on business
                              travel, which accounts for the lion's share of emissions due to transport.
                              </p>
<p>More generally, efforts to control the transport footprint were ongoing in 2016

                              OF OUR WORK </h4>
<p>We conducted around 30 interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the
                              CSR
                              Information in the departments charged with collecting the information and, where
                              appropriate, the people responsible for the internal control and risk management procedures,

                              in order to verify the calculations made and reconcile the data with the supporting

<p>For the other consolidated CSR Information, we assessed consistency based on our

<p>We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes used, based on our professional
                              judgment, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion;
                              a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.
                              Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations intrinsic to the operation
                              of information and internal control systems, we cannot provide absolute assurance

                              OF THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CHIEF
                              EXECUTIVE OFFICER
                              </h4>
<p>The function of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of Chief
                              Executive Officer.
                              </p>
<p>The Board of Directors decided to separate these functions in May 2002, in accordance
                              with Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Company's Articles of Association and with French
                              Law No 2001-420 of 15 May 2001 on new economic regulations. The decision followed
                              the decision of the May 2002 Shareholders' Meeting to change the Company from a société
                              anonyme (public limited company) governed by a Supervisory Board and Management Board
                              to a société anonyme governed by a Board of Directors.
                              </p>
<p>The separation of these functions is in accordance with the provisions of Article
                              L. 511-5B of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which stipulates that the position
                              of Chairman of the Board of Directors of a credit institution may not be held by the
                              Chief Executive Officer.
                              </p>
<p>Mr Philippe Brassac, appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors as the successor
                              to Mr Jean-Paul Chifflet as of 20 May 2015, was reappointed to the function for the
                              duration of his term of office as a Director (meaning until the end of the Ordinary
                              General Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the 201B financial
                              year) as of 9 May 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The Executive Directors, as defined by the French Monetary and Financial Code and
                              the regulations that apply to credit institutions, are Mr Jean-Yves Hocher, Chief
                              Executive Officer, and Messrs François Marion (appointed to replace Mr Paul de Leusse
                              as of 1B May 2016), Regis Monfront and Jacques Prost, Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

                              OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h4>
<p>The Articles of Association of the Company require that the Board of Directors
                              to
                              be composed of between six and twenty Directors: at least six must be appointed by
                              the General Meeting of Shareholders and two must be elected by the employees in accordance
                              with the provisions of Articles L. 225-27 to L. 225-34 of the French Commercial Code.
                              </p>
<p>The term of office of the Directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting is three
                              years (Article 9 of the Articles of Association).
                              </p>
<p>Any Director reaching the age of sixty-five is deemed to have retired from office
                              at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting that follows the date of the birthday
                              in question. However, as an exceptional measure, the term of office of a Director
                              appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting who has reached the age limit may be renewed
                              for a maximum of five subsequent one-year periods, provided the total number of Directors
                              aged 65 or over does not exceed one third of the total number of Directors in office
                              (Article 10 of the Articles of Association).
                              </p>
<p>The two Directors representing the employees are elected for a period that expires
                              the same day: either at the end of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held
                              in the third calendar year following that of their election, or at the end of the
                              electoral process organised during this third calendar year if the process occurs
                              after the Shareholders' Meeting (Article 9 of the Articles of Association).

                              of Shareholders), and appointed Messrs Jacques Ducerf and Nicolas Venard as non-voting

                              Pourre as a non-voting Director.
                              </p>
<p>Messieurs Ducerf and Venard were appointed as non-voting Directors for the purpose
                              of supporting the further development of the relations between Crédit Agricole CIB
                              and the regional banks, especially regarding the monitoring of intermediate-sized
                              enterprises (ETIs). Mrs Pourre was appointed as non-voting Director in order to familiarise
                              herself with the principal challenges facing Crédit Agricole CIB and the way in which
                              the Board of Directors of a credit institution operates, with respect to her proposed
                              appointment as a Director of Crédit Agricole CIB.

<p>After receiving the opinion of the Appointments Committee, the Board of Directors

                              and recommended this status for Mrs Claire Dorland Clauzel upon her appointment by

                              in the control of the Company. However, should the shareholder own more than 10% of
                              the capital or voting rights, the Board, based on a report by the Appointments Committee,
                              must systematically investigate the Director's independence, taking into account the
                              Company's ownership structure and the existence of a potential conflict of interest;(b)
                              The Board of Directors may take the view that a Director who fulfils the aforementioned
                              criteria should not be deemed independent because of his or her particular situation
                              or that of the Company, given the Company's ownership structure or for any other reason.
                              Conversely, the Board may take the view that a director who does not fulfil the above
                              criteria is nevertheless independent.<br/>

</p>
<p>The position of three Independent Directors (Mesdames Daveu, Dorland Clauzel and
                              Noat)
                              was examined against the third criterion. The Appointments Committee and the Board
                              found that the company EUROGROUP Consulting (Mrs Noat) had no relationship with the
                              Company. In addition, they considered the percentage of commercial revenues generated
                              with the Kering Group to which Mrs Daveu belongs, and with the Michelin Group to which
                              Mrs Dorland Clauzel belongs, in relation to the overall commercial revenues of Crédit
                              Agricole CIB. On this basis, the Board found that the business relationships with
                              the Kering Group and the Michelin Group were not of a nature to jeopardise the independence
                              of Mrs Daveu and Dorland Clauzel.
                              </p>
<p>The Appointments Committee and the Board of Directors also found that the respective
                              positions of Mrs Daveu and Mrs Dorland Clauzel within the Kering and Michelin groups
                              did not require them to initiate or conduct direct business relationships with Crédit
                              Agricole CIB.

<p>The position of an Independent Director, namely Mr Veverka, was examined against
                              the
                              first criterion. Mr Veverka holds a number of offices in Crédit Agricole Group companies.
                              The Appointments Committee and the Board of Directors found that this situation was
                              the result of choices made by Crédit Agricole S.A. to entrust the Chairman of its
                              Audit Committee and its Risks Committee with a special role regarding its subsidiaries
                              in order to ensure continuity and consistency in his mission.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; DIVERSITY
                              OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP</h4>
<p>At 31 December 2016, the Board of Directors had six female members, a proportion
                              of
                              43% of the Directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting.
                              </p>
<p>At its meeting held on 2 May 2016, in accordance with Article 435[2 c] of EU Regulation
                              No 575/2013 and Article L. 511-99 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the Appointments
                              Committee reviewed the objective to be reached concerning the balance between women
                              and men on the Board of Directors, as well as the policy to be implemented to achieve
                              it. It was noted during the meeting that under the terms of Article L. 225-17 of the
                              French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors must be constituted to achieve a balanced
                              representation of women and men, said balanced representation meaning in practice
                              a proportion of no less than 40% for each sex, at the end of the first Ordinary General
                              Meeting held after 1 January 2017 in accordance with Article L. 225-18 of the French
                              Commercial Code. The Appointments Committee also noted that the proportion of women
                              among the Directors appointed by the Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank
                              General Meeting of Shareholders was 43% (a percentage that remains unchanged). The
                              Bank has an objective of maintaining this ratio at 40% minimum for each sex. The policy
                              enunciated for this purpose involves actively seeking suitable high quality candidates
                              - both men and women - making it possible to continue to meet this ratio in case of
                              a change in the composition of the Board of Directors while, at the same time, achieving
                              complementarity between the Directors' origins, experience and skills.
                              </p>
<p>Messrs Dreyfus and Kyriacou were appointed as Directors representing employees
                              in
                              accordance with Articles L. 225-27 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. Note that
                              Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, formerly Banque Indosuez, appears on
                              the list appended to Law No 86-793 of 2 July 1986 and, as such, was at one point subject
                              to the provisions of Article 8-1 of Law No 86-912 of 6 August 1986, which called for
                              the presence of Directors representing employees on the Board of Directors.
                              </p>
<p>The composition of the Board of Directors reflects not only the shareholding (Crédit
                              Agricole CIB is more than 99% owned by Crédit Agricole Group companies), but also
                              the desire to bring onboard Directors from diverse backgrounds in terms of education,
                              skills and professional experience (a short résumé of each Director is provided in
                              section 3.2 "Offices and functions performed by the corporate officers" of this Registration

                              FREQUENCY OF BOARD MEETINGS</h4>
<p>The Articles of Association state that the Board shall meet as often as the interests
                              of the Company require, at the request of the Chairman or at least one third of the
                              Directors. The Board's rules of procedures state that, unless otherwise decided by
                              the Chairman, the Board may hold its meeting by means of telecommunication that allow
                              for the identification of Directors and ensure their full participation, provided
                              that at least five Directors are physically present at the location of the Board Meeting
                              (Article 11 of the Articles of Association) and that, in accordance with the law,
                              the proceedings do not concern the preparation and approval of the annual separate
                              and consolidated financial statements and management reports.

                              THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h4>
<p>The powers of the Board of Directors are set out under Article L. 225-35 of the
                              French
                              Commercial Code and are specified in the rules of procedures of the Board, which were
                              modified in July and December 2016, and again in February 2017.
                              </p>
<p>Within the framework of the mission entrusted to it by law and by banking regulations,
                              and in view of the powers vested in the Executive Management, the Board of Directors
                              defines strategy and the Company's general policies. It approves, as necessary and
                              as proposed by the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Deputy Chief Executive Officers,
                              the resources, structures and plans allocated for the implementation of the general
                              strategies and policies it has defined. The Board makes decisions on all matters concerning
                              the governance of the Company referred to it by the Chairman and the Chief Executive
                              Officer as well as on issues concerning fixed and variable compensation submitted

                              the fourth quarter of 2016, based on an individual questionnaire consisting of 61
                              questions sent to each Director. The questions concerned in particular: the organisation
                              of the Board, its operation, its composition and the quality of relationships within
                              it, the work of the various Board committees, and the training and information provided
                              for the Directors. The self-assessment was administered by the Appointments Committee
                              and presented to the Board.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; TRAINING
                              FOR DIRECTORS</h4>
<p>A procedure defined in 2013 to welcome new Directors includes the delivery to any
                              new Director of a welcome booklet, which presents key documents relating to the governance
                              of the Company's corporate bodies, the Company's strategy and budget, the Registration
                              Document and the activity report for the previous year. When a new Director first
                              joins the Board, meetings are also organised between the new Director and Executive
                              Management members, the head of Risks and Permanent Control, the CFO and the head
                              of Compliance and the head of Human Resources.
                              </p>
<p>In addition to the programme established for the benefit of new Directors, training
                              measures for all Directors continued in 2016. As in 2015, a seminar for Directors
                              held in May 2016 provided an opportunity to get a better idea of the expectations
                              of the Bank's customers by meeting the top management of three of the big customers
                              of Crédit Agricole CIB and to gain a deeper understanding of the Bank's business activities
                              and strategy. A training session devoted to a presentation of International Trade
                              and Transaction Banking (ITB), the obligations of the Directors in terms of conflicts
                              of interest and regulatory changes (FRTB) was held in November 2016. Directors also
                              benefit from permanent access to an e-learning programme offering various courses
                              on the theme of compliance.
                              </p>
<p>The training programme planned by the Appointments Committee is expected be further
                              enriched in 2017, with a two-day presentation of all of the Bank's business lines
                              and activities.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-30-2 and R. 225-34-4
                              of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on 9 December
                              2016, determined the training to be followed by employee Directors in 2017.

                              </h4>
<p>The Board has four specialised committees: an Audit Committee, an Appointments
                              Committee,
                              a Compensation Committee and a Risks Committee.

                              </p>
<p>These specialised committees assist the Board of Directors in its duties and in
                              preparing
                              for discussions. They may, for example, conduct studies or submit opinions or recommendations
                              to the Board. The Committees interact where appropriate to ensure consistency in their
                              work. Each committee reports on its work to the Board of Directors so that members
                              can be fully informed when participating in discussions.
                              </p>
<p>Each committee carries out the missions that are assigned by the law and the regulations
                              in force, as well as by the rules of procedures of the Board of Directors and meets
                              periodically and as necessary, in order to review any subject within its jurisdiction.
                              In exercising its mission, it can request access to any information it considers relevant
                              after having informed the Chairman of the Board of Directors of this and, provided
                              it informs the Board of Directors, it may request all studies likely to throw light
                              on the deliberations of the Board at the Company's expense.

                              aimed at controlling activities and risks of all kinds and enabling transactions to

                              ORGANISATION OF CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CIB'S INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS</h4>
<p>In accordance with the principles applied within the Group, Crédit Agricole CIB's
                              internal control system applies to its branches and subsidiaries in France and other
                              countries, irrespective of whether they are under its sole control or joint control.
                              The system is intended to govern and control activities, and to measure and monitor
                              risks on a consolidated basis.
                              </p>
<p>Each entity within the Crédit Agricole CIB Group applies this principle to its
                              own
                              subsidiaries, thus creating a pyramidal internal control structure and strengthening
                              the consistency between different Group entities.
                              </p>
<p>In this way, Crédit Agricole CIB ensures that it has an adequate system within
                              each
                              of its risk-bearing subsidiaries, and those activities, risks and controls are identified
                              and monitored on a consolidated basis within these subsidiaries, particularly as regards
                              accounting and financial information.

<p>The internal control system is based on three levels of controls, which distinguish
                              permanent control from periodic control.

<p>The periodic (third-degree) controls cover occasional onsite audits of accounting
                              records relating to all of the Company's activities and functions by Group Control
                              and Audit.
                              </p>
<p>The system of permanent controls is based on a platform of operational controls
                              and
                              specialised controls. Within the departments at the head office, the branches and
                              the subsidiaries, procedural manuals describe the controls to be performed and the
                              related operational permanent controls.
                              </p>
<p>The controls, which may be integrated into the automated transaction processing
                              systems,
                              are catalogued and updated, largely on the basis of the operational risk map.
                              </p>
<p>The results of the controls are formalised through control records, notably within
                              the SCOPE Group IT system, and are included in periodic summary reports to the appropriate
                              management level (in the branch network and at the head office) and, in a consolidated
                              manner, to the head of Permanent Control and the top-level Permanent Control Committee.
                              </p>
<p>This system is continuously updated. It must specifically cover the entities of
                              the
                              consolidated supervision scope along with changes related to the activity, the organisation
                              and the IT system. In that regard, careful attention is paid to maintaining the quality
                              of operations and a suitable internal control system.

<p>In 2016, the work to coordinate the qualitative component of the Internal Capital
                              Adequacy and Assessment Process (ICAAP) with the Annual Internal Control Report (RACI)
                              continued and a presentation of the conclusions regarding 2015 was prepared for the
                              Bank's governance. In addition, the SCOPE standard control plan underwent an overhaul.

<p>In 2017, beyond the continuation of the work related to ICAAP (methodology, governance,
                              etc.) and the implementation of the new control plan, the governance documents (PELES,
                              etc.) will be updated and a new operational risk mapping system developed.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DETAILED PRESENTATION</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">FIRST-DEGREE CONTROLS</h4>
<p>First-degree controls are carried out by each employee on the transactions he/she
                              handles, by referring to the applicable procedures. They apply to front office units
                              operating within the following business lines: Client Coverage &amp; International
                              Network,
                              Debt Optimisation &amp; Distribution, Distressed Assets, Global Investment Banking,
                              Global
                              Markets Division, International Trade &amp; Transaction Banking and Structured Finance.
                              The controls essentially consist of operational checks by operators or account executives
                              on their positions and limits.
                              </p>
<p>They also apply within support functions.</p>
<p>This first-degree control is given to the local head of the entity, while the head
                              of the business line is responsible at central level.
                              </p>
<p>Operating staff are therefore expected to remain vigilant at all times with regard
                              to the transactions they handle. This should take the form of compliance with all
                              procedures introduced to ensure the procedural compliance, security, validity and
                              completeness of transactions. Each line manager must check, for the activities for
                              which he/she has responsibility, that his/her staff are aware of and comply with the
                              rules and internal procedures for processing transactions.

<p>As well as having responsibility for the administrative processing of all transactions,
                              back offices perform checks on the activities of the front offices during the recording
                              and execution of transactions, namely by comparing data in front-office databases
                              with back-office data and information provided by the counterparties.
                              </p>
<p>These controls are coordinated locally by the entity's head, via the Chief Operating

                              relating to the risk management</h4>
<p>The Risk Management and Permanent Control Department (RPC) is responsible for supervising
                              risks within Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              </p>
<p>The purpose of this department is to control counterparty risks, country risks,
                              market
                              risks, as well as operational and accounting risks. However, structural financial
                              risks are managed by the Finance Department, legal risks by the Legal Department and
                              compliance risks by the Global Compliance Department.
                              </p>
<p>To do this, it oversees the business development of the Group in order to minimise
                              the cost of risk involved in the activities of various businesses and entities or
                              units.
                              </p>
<p>RPC is also responsible for the oversight of the continuous monitoring of risks
                              across
                              the scope of Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              </p>
<p>The risk management and permanent controls organisation within Crédit Agricole
                              CIB
                              forms part of the risk management and permanent controls function set up within the
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. Group.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB holds certain powers in managing its risks. Any cases outside
                              the scope of its powers, as well as certain significant risk strategies, are validated
                              by the Group Risks Committee.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's head of Risk Management and Permanent Controls reports hierarchically
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A.'s Head of Group Risk Management and functionally to Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's Executive Management. He is part of the Bank's Executive Committee
                              (Comex). The Head of Risk Management and Permanent Control is responsible for the
                              risk management and permanent controls function within the meaning of the Decree of
                              3 November 2014, relating to the internal control of banks, payment services companies
                              and investment companies, regulated by the French Prudential Supervisory and Resolution
                              Authority (ACPR).
                              </p>
<p>It should be noted that, on 1 April 2016, a new executive manager joined the Risk
                              and Permanent Control Department of Crédit Agricole CIB. His scope of responsibility
                              and his reporting line remained unchanged.
                              </p>
<p>Within Crédit Agricole CIB, RPC is organised as an independent global business
                              line.
                              It combines all head office risk functions and activities, as well as local and regional
                              officers in the international network and main subsidiaries. Even though their tasks
                              are unchanged, the organisation of the RPC teams responsible for credit risk management
                              changed in January 2016 to adapt to changes in the regulatory and internal environment
                              and to be better able to manage the problems and new tasks.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2016, RPC had a worldwide staff of 1,068 people (permanent full-time
                              equivalents, fixed-term contracts and work-study trainees - including subsidiaries
                              and Wealth Management activities).
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has implemented a set of procedures that determines risk monitoring,
                              risk control and permanent control arrangements. The set of procedures is updated
                              regularly to improve risk measurement and supervision and to take into account the
                              evolution of the regulatory context. As such, 2016 was used in particular to reconcile
                              governance texts with the new RPC organisation, major regulatory developments or recommendations
                              of the various internal and external audit bodies. In addition, a new governance text
                              was written to specify the procedures for validation of models developed by ALM. A
                              review of the corpus of texts relating to permanent control and operational risks
                              is planned in 2017.

                              operational consequences from the review, depending on whether its conclusions are

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Risk Master Plan</h4>
<p>The master plan addresses the need to take a medium-term view of risk policy. It
                              is
                              managed by a team within the "Counterparty Risk Organisation, Projects and Operational
                              Management" (OPG) unit, which is part of the Crédit Agricole CIB Risk and Permanent
                              Control Department.
                              </p>
<p>The master plan thus seeks to manage - through regulatory and organisational projects
                              and applications covering the three main types of risk (counterparty, market and operational
                              risk) - the key areas for improvement enabling Crédit Agricole CIB to gain a quicker
                              and deeper understanding of its risks, incorporating the Group's strategic decisions
                              as well as the new regulatory requirements (BCBS 239/BCBS 268, Fundamental Review
                              of the Trading Book, etc.).
                              </p>
<p>A steering committee, chaired by a member of the Executive Management, brings together
                              representatives of all the risk and IT divisions and monitors the twenty or so projects
                              or programmes that have been selected.
                              </p>
<p>Currently, the main strategic focus of the master plan is on the following regulatory
                              requirements:

<p>In addition, it includes a review of the CORSAIRE project, aimed at providing users

                              regulatory needs and the increased requirements of the regulator (AQR, BCBS239, reporting,
                              etc.) in terms of quality and risk monitoring.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Counterparty risks</h4>
<p>Any counterparty or group of counterparties is subject to limitations within the
                              framework
                              of specific procedures.
                              </p>
<p>The decision process is based on two authorised signatures from the front office
                              (one
                              as responsible for the application, the other being the Delegated Chairman of the
                              relevant committee) as well as an independent RPC opinion issued by an Authorised
                              Signatory. If the RPC's opinion is negative, the decision-making power is passed on
                              to the Chairman of the Committee immediately above.
                              </p>
<p>Credit decisions are subject to risk strategies defined for each significant scope
                              (country, business line, sector), establishing the main guidelines (target customer
                              base, types of approved products, total budgets and expected unit values, etc.) within
                              which each geographical unit or business line must conduct its activities.
                              </p>
<p>When a case is considered to be outside the framework of the risk strategy in force,
                              intermediary authorisations do not apply and a decision can only be made by the Executive
                              Management-level Committee (CRC). The RPC also identifies assets that may deteriorate
                              as soon as possible and initiates the most suitable measures to protect the Bank's
                              interests.
                              </p>
<p>The process for monitoring receivables is enhanced by a system of portfolio and
                              sub-portfolio
                              analyses on group-wide business line, geographical or sector basis. Analysing concentrations
                              and, if applicable, recommendations for the reorganisation of the portfolio are an
                              integral part of this exercise.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, portfolio reviews are organised periodically for each profit centre
                              in
                              order to verify that the portfolio complies with the risk strategy in force.
                              </p>
<p>The rating of certain counterparties under review may be adjusted at this time.</p>
<p>In parallel, the new activities and new products management mechanism (NAP Committee)
                              ensures that all requests made by the businesses are in line with the strategies and
                              risks involved.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, sensitive cases and major risks are monitored quarterly; other risks
                              are reviewed annually. The adequacy of the level of reserves in relation to risk is
                              assessed every quarter by the Executive Management, on the recommendation of the RPC.
                              </p>
<p>This approach also involves stress tests, aimed at assessing the impact of unfavourable
                              macroeconomic assumptions and quantifying the risks to which the bank may be exposed
                              in an unfavourable climate.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Country risks</h4>
<p>Country risks are subject to an assessment and monitoring system based on a specific
                              rating methodology. Country ratings, which are updated at least quarterly, have a
                              direct impact on the limits applied to each country for the validation of their risk
                              strategy and on counterparty ratings.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, RPC will consider whether to change the country risk management procedures.</p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Market risks</h4>
<p>Upstream market risk management takes place through several committees that assess
                              risks associated with activities, products and strategies before they are introduced
                              or implemented:

                              Trading Book, now managed jointly with the Masai project, intended to redesign the
                              market risk ecosystem in accordance with the requirements of BCBS 239.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Operational risks</h4>
<p>Operational risk management relies mainly on a network of Permanent Control correspondents
                              coordinated by the RPC.
                              </p>
<p>Operational risks are monitored for each business line, subsidiary and each region,
                              which ensure the reporting of losses and incidents, as well as their analysis, by
                              Internal Control Committees.
                              </p>
<p>In addition to actual losses, the operational risk scorecard methodology takes
                              into
                              account provisions, specifically for legal disputes since the end of 2013 and tax
                              disputes since the end of 2015.
                              </p>
<p>Each quarter, the RPC produces an operational risk scorecard showing movements
                              in
                              operational risk-related costs and associated key events.
                              </p>
<p>Remedial action following significant incidents is monitored closely, in conjunction
                              with business lines and support functions.
                              </p>
<p>The operational risk map covering all business lines at head office, the international
                              network and subsidiaries is revised every year. Together with the compliance and legal
                              functions, the RPC takes into account non-compliance risks and legal risks.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, several specialists were recruited to the head office, in order to take
                              into
                              account French and international regulations concerning capital markets (Volcker rule,
                              French banking law) and IT system security (Information System Risk control). In the
                              past year, the extreme risk scenarios (see Group Advanced Measurement Approach) that
                              could affect CACIB have also been updated, to take account of the major events of
                              the year and the outsourcing of certain activities. For 2017, it is planned to continue
                              the analysis of migration to an integrated solution including the operational risk
                              mapping and taking into account the work to identify key CACIB processes (driven by
                              the Business Transformation Strategy Department), as well as the expected changes
                              in the Group risk baselines.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Provision of essential
                              outsourced services (PSEE)</h4>
<p>Any service or operational task classed as essential must meet certain monitoring
                              requirements defined as part of a procedure that in particular sets forth the way
                              in which outsourcing decisions are taken, the elements to be included in the contract
                              and the supervision procedures to ensure that all associated risks are managed and
                              that the service runs smoothly.
                              </p>
<p>A dedicated governance (Outsourcing Committee) keeps track of the services, at
                              Executive
                              Management level, complemented by specialist monitoring in the areas most affected
                              by outsourcing (computing and back-office).

                              presented to the top-level Permanent Control Committee.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the CACIB services monitoring system was improved globally. For 2017,
                              beyond
                              the deployment of the new integrated IT solution (see "Operational risks" paragraph),
                              several actions are still expected to improve the organisation (development of expertise)
                              and fine-tune the methodology (criticality of services) in order to improve the quality
                              of the monitoring and consolidated reporting, in connection with the completion of
                              projects conducted at Group level.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PERMANENT CONTROL
                              OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>The objectives of the permanent control of accounting and financial information
                              are
                              to provide adequate protection against major accounting risks that may damage the
                              quality of the information. Crédit Agricole CIB applied the Crédit Agricole Group's
                              recommendations in this area.
                              </p>
<p>Thus, the Permanent Accounting Control of the Risk Management Department ensures
                              the
                              permanent control of the last level of accounting and financial information (second-degree,
                              second-level control [2.2] and consolidated second-degree, second-level control [2.2.C]).
                              In this regard it has the following tasks:

                              requirements</h4>
<p>Within the framework of Basel II regulations, Crédit Agricole CIB uses an approach
                              based on internal models approved by the French Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR,
                              or Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution) for calculating capital requirements
                              with respect to Credit and market risks as well as operational risk.
                              </p>
<p>These patterns are part of the risk management device of Crédit Agricole CIB, they
                              are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their effective performance
                              and use.
                              </p>
<p>Regarding credit risk, Corporate Unsecured credit models (credit rating and/or
                              LGD),
                              LBO, Aerospace, Insurance and Maritime Financing were re-calibrated in 2016; some
                              of them will require prior notification to the European Central Bank (ECB) prior to
                              their implementation in our information systems. Moreover, all PD and LGD models were
                              back-tested during 2016; the results of this work will be presented to the CACIB Executive
                              Committee in the first quarter of 2017 and then to the CASA Standards and Methodologies
                              Committee in the first half of 2017. In addition, the benchmarking of our internal
                              ratings are made on the Low Default Portfolio (Large corporates, Banks and Governments)
                              perimeters as well compared to agency ratings outside those of other European banks
                              that participate in the annual RWA benchmarking exercise organised by the European
                              Banking Authority (EBA). A summary of this work will be presented to the CACIB Executive
                              Committee in the first quarter of 2017 (as well as the back-testing results). It should
                              be noted that the changes to our existing models and the development of new models
                              are intended first to measure our risks as accurately as possible, and second to accompany
                              the regulatory changes that apply to banks. Correct application of the Basel system
                              is regularly monitored by a Basel Requirements Review Committee.
                              </p>
<p>In 2017, the RCP/MRP teams will continue to work on:</p>
<p>i. The new Basel consultation process on the constraints of using internal models
                              (impact studies by business line presented in Executive Committee meetings, contribution
                              to Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) exercises organised by the Basel Committee and
                              the ACPR, making each business line aware of the impacts of this reform on their activity);
                              </p>
<p>ii. The preparation of the ECB audit referred to as TRIM (Targeted Review of Internal
                              Models) on credit risk.
                              </p>
<p>As regards the new capital requirements in relation to counterparty risk in market
                              transactions contained in CRD IV/CRR1, these have been implemented since 2013. After
                              obtaining authorisation from the ACPR in May 2014, Crédit Agricole CIB has been able
                              to use its internal risk model on market transactions for calculating capital requirements
                              since the 31 March 2014 closing. This authorisation covers the use of the Internal
                              Model Method for calculating the counterparty risk and of the Advanced Method for
                              calculating the credit value adjustment risk (CVA) on the main part of the calculation
                              scope.
                              </p>
<p>As regards operational risk, Crédit Agricole CIB uses a method based on the Crédit
                              Agricole Group's internal model, which in turn is based on our loss history and also
                              includes a number of risk scenarios, which are reviewed every year.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Accounting data</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB closes its accounts monthly. Parent company and consolidated
                              financial
                              statements are established using the Crédit Agricole Group's accounting standards,
                              which are circulated by Crédit Agricole S.A.'s Accounting and Consolidation Department.
                              The accounting treatment of complex instruments and transactions undergoes prior analysis
                              by the Accounting Standards unit of Crédit Agricole CIB's Finance Department. In view
                              of the entry into force on 1 January 2018 of the IFRS 9 standard, the Finance Department
                              has undertaken various analysis studies and computer developments in connection with
                              Crédit Agricole S.A.. A specific review of this work by the Statutory Auditors is
                              scheduled.
                              </p>
<p>Each Crédit Agricole CIB Group entity produces a consolidation package which is
                              used
                              to populate the general Crédit Agricole Group system managed by Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              Group Financial Control issues quarterly closing instructions to the Finance Departments
                              of Crédit Agricole CIB entities to define the reporting schedules and to specify certain
                              accounting treatments and the type of information to be collected over the period,
                              particularly with a view to preparing the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Management data</h4>
<p>Most financial information published by Crédit Agricole CIB is based on accounting
                              data and on management data.
                              </p>
<p>All management data is checked to ensure that it has been properly reconciled with
                              the accounting data and that it complies with the management standards set by the
                              governance bodies.
                              </p>
<p>Each entity reconciles the main items of its management results with the intermediate
                              income statement balances produced from accounting data. Group Financial Control checks
                              that the sum of business-line results equals the sum of entity results, which must
                              in turn be equal to the Crédit Agricole CIB Group's consolidated results. This check
                              is made easier by the fact that the analytical unit (profit centre) is integrated
                              within the entities' accounting information system.
                              </p>
<p>Management data are prepared using calculation methods that ensure they are comparable
                              over time. When published data are not extracted directly from accounting information,
                              the sources and definition of calculation methods are generally mentioned to facilitate
                              understanding.

                              compliance controls, fulfilment of declaration obligations to supervisory authorities,

                              known as CARS.

<p>2017 will see the implementation of a new CARS 2017 security plan led by the CA
                              Group.
                              The steering of the various security sites included in Vauban will then be handled
                              via the CARS plan. This plan will also integrate the steering of both national and
                              international regulatory sites concerning ISS. The deployment of DLP solutions will
                              be continued, as well as a project for the transformation of our privileges management
                              mechanisms.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Business Continuity
                              Plan (BCP)</h4>
<p>In business continuity matters, the BCP Division defines the governance and business
                              continuity policies for the entire Group. For the head office, the BCP Division introduces
                              redundancy to ensure business recovery within the time required by the business lines
                              in the event of an incident. Annual tests make it possible to verify the Crédit Agricole
                              CIB's recovery capabilities, both in France and abroad.
                              </p>
<p>The goals of this plan are to ensure employee security, by adopting special protective
                              measures, and to ensure the continuity of the Bank's essential activities. An annual
                              assessment makes it possible to verify the effectiveness of the IT security and business
                              continuity system. The BCP Division reports on Crédit Agricole CIB's level of security
                              to a quarterly committee which is chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible
                              for Support functions.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">THIRD DEGREE CONTROLS</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Periodic control</h4>
<p>The Audit-Inspection function performs periodic control of Crédit Agricole CIB
                              (CACIB)
                              within all entities falling under its consolidated supervision perimeter. Nearly 196
                              people (full-time equivalent) work in the Group's Internal Audit units. Of these,
                              approximately 79 were based at the head office at the end of 2016.
                              </p>
<p>CACIB's Internal Audit unit is part of the Internal Audit Business Line (LMAI)
                              of
                              the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group. As such, the CACIB Head of Control and Audit is hierarchically
                              attached to the head of Control and Audit of Crédit Agricole S.A. and functionally
                              to the Chief Executive Officer of CACIB, to whom he reports on work and investigations
                              completed. Moreover, neither Group Control and Audit nor local audit units have any
                              responsibility or authority over the activities they control, which guarantees their
                              independence.
                              </p>
<p>To perform its duties, the Internal Audit unit is organised around two sections:
                              the
                              central audit team and the team handling audits of regional branches and subsidiaries.
                              A head of relations with regulators completes this organisation.
                              </p>
<p>Group Control and Audit has the task of assessing, via periodic control missions,
                              the effectiveness of the internal control system within Crédit Agricole CIB and all
                              of its subsidiaries. In this capacity, it carries out missions within entities to
                              ensure:

<p>During the 2016 financial year, Internal Audit missions pertained to various entities
                              and units in France and abroad through specific mission (concerning an entity or subsidiary),
                              business line reviews and missions of the thematic or cross-departmental type, including
                              IT and regulatory audits. Group Control and Audit also carries out specific missions
                              at the request of CACIB's Executive Management, its Risks Committee or Group Internal
                              Audit.
                              </p>
<p>Audits are, for the most part, based on the annual audit plan, established from
                              an
                              updated mapping approach to risk, as well as on exchanges with other control functions,
                              Executive Management and the Risks Committee. This translates into a cycle of audit
                              usually lasting between two and five years. After validation by the Executive Management
                              of CACIB and the Group Control and Audit of Crédit Agricole S.A., the audit plan is
                              submitted for approval to the CACIB Risks Committee. The conclusions, resulting from
                              studies conducted by Internal Control and Audit, are communicated to Crédit Agricole
                              CIB's Executive Management, to the Chairman of Crédit Agricole CIB's Board of Directors
                              and to Crédit Agricole S.A.'s Control and Audit.

                              POLICY</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">5.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
                              OF THE COMPENSATION POLICY</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has established a responsible compensation policy aimed at
                              reflecting
                              its values and respecting the interests of all stakeholders, be they employees, customers
                              or shareholders.
                              </p>
<p>In line with the specific characteristics of its business lines, legal entities,
                              and
                              national and international legislation, Crédit Agricole CIB strives to develop a system
                              of compensation that provides its employees with competitive compensation relative
                              to its benchmark markets to attract and retain the best talent. To this end comparisons
                              with other financial groups are made on a regular basis.
                              </p>
<p>Compensation, particularly variable ones, are aimed at rewarding individual and
                              group
                              performance over time while promoting sound and risk-aware management.
                              </p>
<p>The compensation policy of Crédit Agricole CIB contributes to compliance with the
                              risk appetite statement and framework approved by governance.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's compensation policy must also be seen within a closely regulated
                              environment specific to the banking sector. In general, Crédit Agricole CIB ensures
                              the compliance of its compensation policy with the national, European and international
                              legal and regulatory environment in effect. In particular, it complies with the provisions
                              of the following regulations:

<p>All or part of this package may be offered to each employee, according to their

                              of responsibility, skills, performance and location.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ A - FIXED COMPENSATION</h4>
<p>Fixed compensation rewards employees for the responsibilities conferred on them
                              and
                              for the skills implemented to exercise these, in line with the specific characteristics
                              of each business line in their local market.
                              </p>
<p>These responsibilities are characterised by a mission and contributions, the employee's
                              level in the organisation, and his or her expected skills and experience profile.
                              </p>
<p>Fixed compensation is determined in proportions such that it is possible to not
                              award
                              variable compensation in the event of insufficient performance.
                              </p>
<p>Changes to an employee's fixed compensation depend on his or her progress in terms
                              of responsibilities and control of position, which are assessed during the annual
                              review of the employee's mission performance and permanent contributions to the position.
                              </p>
<p>When an employee takes up a new position, any changes in responsibility are taken
                              into consideration when determining the fixed compensation.
                              </p>
<p>Fixed compensation is made up of a basic salary and any other stable and recurring
                              compensation component independent of performance.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ B - ANNUAL
                              INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION</h4>
<p>Variable compensation is directly tied to individual and collective annual performance.
                              Individual performance is assessed based on the achievement of qualitative and quantitative
                              objectives as well as proper compliance with internal rules and procedures.
                              </p>
<p>Collective performance is based on the determination of an amount set aside across
                              the Bank as a whole, which is then broken down by activity. These amounts are determined
                              so as to not limit the capacity of Crédit Agricole CIB to increase its equity if necessary.
                              It takes all risks into account, including liquidity risk, as well as the cost of
                              capital, in compliance with regulatory principles.
                              </p>
<p>Variable compensation is made up of the bonus and any other individual compensation
                              component linked to performance, including guaranteed variable compensation.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; 1 - COMPOSITION
                              OF COMPENSATION POOLS</h4>
<p>The total variable compensation pool of Crédit Agricole CIB is determined according
                              to the contribution and by setting a distribution rate.
                              </p>
<p>The contribution is determined using the following formula, based on the usual

                              COMPENSATION ALLOCATIONS</h4>
<p>Bonuses are financed based on the overall amount set aside for each business line
                              and shared between individual employees by line management through a broad assessment
                              of their individual and collective performances, including quantitative and qualitative
                              components. There is no direct, automatic link between an employee's financial results
                              and his or her variable compensation to avoid any risks of conflicts of interest or
                              the risk that customer interests will not be taken into account.
                              </p>
<p>Individual allocations take account of failure to comply with compliance rules
                              and
                              procedures, and risk limits, as part of the rules and procedures drawn up by Crédit
                              Agricole CIB. Decisions affecting individual variable compensation for employees with
                              noted high-risk behaviour are subject to annual review by Executive Management.
                              </p>
<p>In some cases, the bonus is supplemented by other items of variable compensation
                              as
                              is the case for Senior Executives.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; 3 - GUARANTEED
                              VARIABLE COMPENSATION</h4>
<p>Payment of guaranteed variable compensation is authorised only in connection with
                              the hiring of a new employee and only for a period not exceeding one year. On recruitment,

                              </p>
<p>Variable compensation is allocated in such a way as to avoid rewarding or promoting
                              prohibited trading activities, but can be used to reward revenue generation or the
                              provision of services to customers and must therefore comply with internal policies
                              and procedures, including the Volcker compliance manual.
                              </p>
<p>Among other things, the individual performance bonus is based on an appraisal of

                              in strict compliance with the terms of the mandate managed.
                              </p>
<p>Quarterly checks are carried out by the Risk Management Department and by the Market
                              Activities Department to ensure that the terms of office are correctly applied.
                              </p>
<p>As part of the end-of-year reviews, management assesses the employees' performance
                              in view of the targets set at the start of the year, including their compliance with
                              the trading terms of office. This assessment takes account of behaviour that is not
                              compliant with the internal rules and procedures or risk limits, and in particular
                              failure to comply with the terms of office.

                              do not take account of criteria relating to the results or financial performance of
                              the sectors which they control. The amounts are defined according to market practice.

                              </p>
<p>Until 31 August 2015, under the office of Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole CIB, Mr Jean-Yves
                              Hocher's compensation was determined by Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB
                              Board meetings, after being reviewed by the respective Compensation Committees.
                              </p>
<p>For holding these two terms of office, this compensation was defined on basis of
                              the
                              time devoted to Crédit Agricole CIB (85%) and to Crédit Agricole S.A. (15%). Therefore,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB paid 85% of the amounts paid and awarded.
                              </p>

                              Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A. came to an end, leading to the reinstatement
                              of his employment contract, which had been suspended throughout his term of office.
                              </p>
<p>Concomitantly with this reinstatement it was decided, with the agreement of the
                              latter,
                              that his compensation would be fully borne by Crédit Agricole S.A. from this date
                              onwards. This change was approved by the Crédit Agricole CIB Board of Directors on
                              29 October 2015. Thus, since 1 September 2015, Mr Jean-Yves Hocher has exercised his

                              </p>
<p>Mr Régis Monfront is a beneficiary of the supplementary pension scheme for Senior
                              Executives of Crédit Agricole CIB (closed pension), which supplements the collective
                              and mandatory pension and death &amp; disability plans.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with the procedure governing related-party agreements, the Board
                              of
                              Directors of Crédit Agricole CIB, meeting on 2 November 2016, again approved Mr Régis
                              Monfront's participation in the supplementary pension schemes of Crédit Agricole CIB
                              upon the renewal of his term of office. This participation was already approved by
                              the General Meeting of Shareholders of Crédit Agricole CIB, following approval by
                              the Board of Directors at the meeting held on 21 February 2012 at the time of his
                              appointment, and that held on 5 November 2013 upon first renewal of his term of office.
                              Mr Régis Monfront has at least fifteen years' service and has already reached the
                              maximum applicable replacement ratio before the renewal of his term of office as Deputy
                              Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, his renewed term of office does not entail
                              any new conditional rights (supplementary replacement ratio) as defined in paragraphs
                              2, 7 and 8 of Article L. 225-42-1 as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015.
                              There is therefore no requirement to make the payment of his supplementary pension
                              scheme conditional on his performance and paragraphs 2, 7 and 8 of Article L. 225-42-1,
                              as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, do not apply given that no new conditional
                              rights apply to his renewed term of office.

                              As this comes under the defined-benefit plan, the annual vesting of entitlements is

                              2015. The annual vesting of Mr Prost's entitlements will therefore be subject to Crédit

                              and mandatory pension and death &amp; disability plans.
                              </p>
<p>The Board of Directors of Crédit Agricole CIB, meeting on 2 November 2016, approved
                              Mr François Marion's participation in the supplementary pension schemes of Crédit
                              Agricole CIB upon the renewal of his term of office. This participation was already
                              approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of 9 May 2016 upon his appointment.
                              Mr François Marion has at least fifteen years' service and has already reached the
                              maximum applicable replacement ratio before the renewal of his term of office as Deputy
                              Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, his renewed term of office does not entail
                              any new conditional rights (supplementary replacement ratio) as defined in paragraphs
                              2, 7 and 8 of Article L. 225-42-1 as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015.
                              There is therefore no requirement to make the payment of his supplementary pension
                              scheme conditional on his performance and paragraphs 2, 7 and 8 of Article L. 225-42-1,
                              as amended by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, do not apply given that no new conditional
                              rights apply to his renewed term of office.

<p>The estimated total of these supplementary pension entitlements, taken together
                              with
                              estimated pensions from mandatory retirement schemes, triggers the application of
                              the contractual cap of 16 times the annual social security cap as of the closing date,
                              for all schemes.
                              </p>
<p>The uncertain entitlements under the defined-benefit supplementary pension scheme
                              are subject to continued employment conditions at retirement and are estimated on
                              the basis of 34 years of service recorded on the closing date.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2016, there was no increase in the estimated conditional entitlements
                              (expressed as a percentage of the benchmark compensation) as compared to 31 December
                              2015.
                              </p>
<p>On this basis, the provisions of Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code,
                              modified by Law No 2015-990 of 6 August 2015 on economic growth, activity and equal
                              economic opportunities, which limits any increase in these conditional rights to 3%
                              per annum, were thus respected.
                              </p>
<p>The published estimated amounts are the gross amounts before taxes and social security
                              charges applicable at the closing date, particularly income tax payable by individuals
                              and supplementary contributions of 7% and 14%, payable by the beneficiary, which are
                              deducted from the life annuities payable under the defined-benefit supplementary pension
                              scheme.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.2 ECONOMIC AND
                              FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT</h4>
<p>2016 was rich in noteworthy events prompting significant volatility and contrasting
                              trends in the financial markets, without fundamentally altering short-term trajectories
                              in the various economies. 2015 had ended with a slowdown in global economic activity,
                              with large disparities from one area to another: slower growth in China (a slowdown
                              compounded by doubts as to its true extent), fragility in the United States, stagnation
                              in emerging countries but faster growth in Europe. 2016 accordingly began in a feverish
                              climate in the financial markets, against a background of concerns about the solidity
                              of the banking system and more specifically the solvency of some Italian and German
                              banks. Subsequently, two political shocks, both as dreaded they were unforeseen, namely
                              Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, gave the markets a vigorous shake, provoking
                              reactions that were both negative and positive. This was despite the fact that the
                              economic, financial and political implications of these upheavals, both on the economies
                              concerned and those of their partners, were and remain unknown. In early 2016, the
                              outlines of the economic scenario were relatively simple to draw, particularly in
                              the developed world: modest growth and an absence of inflation. But the financial
                              markets feared an unfavourable scenario characterized by a pronounced slowdown in
                              Chinese growth, the uncontrolled impairment of its currency, a fresh plunge in commodity
                              prices, a slowdown in American growth, deflation in the Eurozone and, lastly, a slide
                              by the emerging world into recession. These fears triggered a spike in risk aversion
                              and prompted a desperate search for defensive assets. This resulted in lower yields
                              on US and core Eurozone country debt, with the risk premiums paid by the socalled
                              "peripheral" countries increasing as spreads in the credit markets widened. Significant
                              declines were also registered across equity markets.
                              </p>
<p>However, gradually reassured by the comforting message delivered by the central
                              banks,
                              the markets once again began to look upwards. This episode of market volatility in
                              the first part of 2016 did not fundamentally alter the overall economic picture. To
                              counter financial turmoil and limit its potential to damage the real economy, the
                              Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) modified their monetary
                              policy strategies. The Fed and the ECB respectively opted for a more cautious and
                              a more flexible policy: the former deferred the increase in the Fed Funds rate, while
                              the latter took vigorous action in March (cutting its three policy rates, broadening
                              the quantitative easing policy and implementing a new series of Targeted Longer-Term
                              Refinancing Operations).
                              </p>
<p>After the return of relative calm in the markets, two very decisive and profoundly
                              unexpected political events upset the second half of 2016. First, at the end of June
                              2016, a majority of British voters came out in favour of the United Kingdom's exit
                              from the European Union. Taken by surprise, the financial markets reacted strongly,
                              shunning anything that carried the slightest hint of risk. The flight to safety further
                              reduced interest rates on US, Japanese and German government bonds. But, with the
                              exception of the impairment of the British pound, the correction was only shortlived.
                              Then, in November 2016, American voters put Donald Trump into the White House. Turning
                              a deaf ear to talk of geopolitical risks, and ignoring potential trade wars in an
                              already fragile global economic environment, the markets were seduced by the prospect
                              of accelerated growth, driven largely by promises of corporate tax cuts and infrastructure
                              spending. The price of gold fell, equity markets rose, the dollar firmed appreciably,
                              and longterm American and European bond yields tightened. Despite the financial turbulence
                              and multiple uncertainties, the large developed economies have demonstrated resilience.
                              The Eurozone's recovery, driven by strong domestic demand, has been confirmed. In
                              the United States, growth has continued at a slightly slower pace: household consumption
                              and residential investment have remained strong, but productive investment has not
                              recovered, and foreign trade has contributed negatively to growth. Growth is estimated
                              at 1.6% in the Eurozone and the United States alike in 2016. Lastly, in December 2016,
                              the Fed began tightening its monetary policy (25 basis point hike in the Fed Funds
                              rate), while the ECB further relaxed its policy by opting to extend its quantitative
                              easing policy.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">THE IMPACT OF
                              BREXIT</h4>
<p>British voters' decision to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union (popularly
                              termed Brexit) will undoubtedly have major consequences for the financial services
                              industry in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. Crédit Agricole CIB and the
                              Group remain committed to studying all such consequences, whether direct on the capacity
                              of entities based in the United Kingdom to operate in the European Union or vice versa,
                              or indirect on the smooth running of the British, European or even global economies
                              and markets. Crédit Agricole CIB and the Group have all the European passports necessary
                              to continue to operate all of its businesses and to serve all of its customers, regardless
                              of the exit arrangements negotiated between the British government and the European
                              Union. Its operations in the United Kingdom are relatively small in proportion to
                              its business portfolio as a whole, and could be largely relocated if the conditions
                              governing operations from the London platform were to change.

<p>After a stormy start to the year, the markets saw a period of calm starting at
                              the
                              end of the first quarter due to the actions of the central banks and especially the
                              ECB with the extension of its repurchase programme for Corporates. Market volatility
                              nevertheless reappeared in May with various uncertainties around global growth and
                              initial fears about Brexit.
                              </p>
<p>The second half-year was also affected by a number of periods of uncertainty relating
                              to important political events, including the Presidential elections in America and
                              the referendum in Italy, whose outcomes, once known, produced further market volatility.
                              </p>
<p>The end of the year also saw changes to the monetary policies of the American and
                              European central banks: the FED increased its benchmark rates following an improvement
                              in the business climate in the United States and the ECB announced that it would continue
                              its repurchasing programme and that it would keep its benchmark rates unchanged.
                              </p>
<p>The CIB's business was able to benefit from this difficult environment, seeing
                              an
                              8% increase in revenues over the year to stand at €4,427 million at end December 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Revenues generated by Capital Markets and Investment Banking improved by 12% due
                              to
                              the very good performance of the Fixed Income and Securitisation businesses, especially
                              Repo, Credit and Foreign Exchange related income. Revenues from Investment Banking
                              were also up thanks to significant transactions in terms of M&amp;A and Equity Capital
                              Markets.
                              </p>
<p>Revenues from Financing Activities rose by 4% compared to 2015. The Structured
                              Finance
                              business achieved good levels of origination despite a difficult climate in certain
                              sectors (Energy and Shipping). The Commercial Banking business showed resilience in
                              a market environment that remains unfavourable (a slowing in global trade and an average
                              17% fall in the price of oil year-on-year).
                              </p>
<p>Increase in expenses remained under control and were due to further support for
                              growth
                              in the businesses, as well as the large number of regulatory projects. The Bank's
                              cost-to-income ratio stood at 62% at year-end 2016.
                              </p>
<p>CIB's restated gross operating income rose by 17% year-on-year, a result of the
                              outstanding
                              performance of the operating businesses.
                              </p>
<p>Excluding legal provisions, the cost of risk rose significantly compared to 2015
                              due
                              to the downturn in the Energy and Shipping sectors.
                              </p>
<p>Excluding impairment of UBAF and ELIPSO in 2015 for -€186 million, net income from
                              the equity-accounted entities was down by 14% as compared to 2015, adversely affected
                              by the increased cost of risk of Banque Saudi Fransi related to a fully provisioned
                              credit event in the fourth quarter of 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Revenues from the Wealth Management business line was down by 5% compared to 2015,
                              and suffered from the wait-and-see attitude of clients for the major part of the year,
                              despite a recovery in business volumes in the fourth quarter 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Results for the Corporate Centre include the revaluation of the issuer spread amounting
                              to -€159 million, a result of the tightening of spreads in 2016.

<p>Capital Markets and Investment Banking achieved an excellent performance in most
                              business
                              lines with revenues up by 12% year-on-year.
                              </p>
<p>Revenues from the Fixed income &amp; Treasury businesses showed progress in relation
                              to
                              2015. Revenues from the Fixed Income business was mainly driven by the good performance
                              of Repo. The Foreign Exchange business benefited from the renewed market volatility
                              that followed the result of the Brexit referendum. Finally, the Credit business benefited
                              from the extension of the ECB corporate asset repurchasing programme in March, which
                              drove demand for issues.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB maintained its global leadership as bookrunner in the Asset
                              Backed
                              Commercial Paper (ABCP) securitisation business in Europe for the third consecutive
                              year (source: CPWare) and is ranked second in the world for Green Bonds (source: CACIB).
                              The Bank was active in some of the most memorable transactions of 2016, including
                              that involving Sanofi (first corporate bond issue to result in a negative yield),
                              which was nominated "European Investment Grade Corporate Bond of the Year" in the
                              2016 IFR Awards. CACIB also took part in the biggest ever issue conducted by a French
                              group (Danone) and the issue of the biggest ever tranche of Euro-denominated Green
                              Bonds with EDF.
                              </p>
<p>Revenues from Investment Banking also rose by 12% thanks to major M&amp;A transactions
                              as well as capital increases and issues of convertible bonds in the Equity Capital
                              Markets business line. Crédit Agricole CIB also moved from 14th to 4th place in the
                              rankings for mergers &amp; acquisitions in France involving at least one French company.
                              Elsewhere, the Bank maintained its second place as a bookrunner for convertible bonds
                              in France (source: Thomson Financial).
                              </p>
<p>Net income Group share for Capital Markets and Investment Banking reached €468
                              million,

<p>Revenues from Financing Activities were up by 4% in relation to the 2015 financial
                              year despite an unfavourable economic environment, particularly for certain Commercial
                              Banking activities.
                              </p>
<p>The Structured Finance revenues grew by 4% (+5% at constant rates) due to the combined
                              effect of a good level of origination and increased commissions related to some significant
                              deals across the year. In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB obtained the following awards:
                              Best Project Finance Arranger of the Year (source: Global capital) and "European Bank
                              of the Year for Aeronautics" (source: Airline Economics).
                              </p>
<p>The Bank also maintained its leading global position in aviation financing (source:
                              Air Finance).
                              </p>
<p>The different business lines of the Commercial Bank showed resilience in a persistently
                              unfavourable environment (contraction of syndicated credit volumes and a continued
                              low interest rate environment), but with a slight improvement in the final quarter
                              for the Trade Commodity Finance business as the crude oil price slightly increased.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB achieved to maintain its second place in the syndication business
                              in France (source: Thomson Financial) in a syndicated credit market that lost ground
                              in France in 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The cost of risk increased in 2016 due to the reinforcement of sectorial provisions
                              for Energy and Shipping.
                              </p>
<p>Excluding impairment of UBAF and ELIPSO in 2015, the share of income of the equity-accounted
                              entities fell by 14% year-on-year, adversely affected by the increased cost of risk
                              for Banque Saudi Fransi related to a fully provisioned credit event in the fourth
                              quarter of 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Net income Group share for Financing activities nevertheless showed strong growth
                              of 6%, standing at €858 million.

<p>Revenues from Wealth Management were down by 5% as compared to 2015 due to a reduction

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has access to all major international liquidity centres and

                              very active in the largest financial markets (Paris, New York, London and Tokyo),

                              ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS</h4>
<p>Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (excluding
                              repurchase
                              agreements) were down by €21.5 billion and €14.4 billion respectively over the period.
                              On the asset side, they consist mainly in the positive fair value of interest rate
                              derivatives and of the portfolio of securities held for trading, while on the liabilities
                              side they reflect the negative value of derivatives and securities sold short. The
                              reduction in outstanding amounts results mainly from the decline in mark-to-market
                              derivatives (-€13.4 billion on the asset side and -€12.6 billion on the liabilities
                              side), especially in interest rate derivatives.

<p>The repo activities are largely concentrated in Paris, which accounted for 63%
                              of
                              securities purchased and 68% of securities sold under repurchase agreements. The decline
                              in securities purchased and sold under repurchase agreements in 2016 stemmed primarily
                              from the reduction in trading activities at CACIB Paris and CACIB New York.

                              AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK</h4>
<p>As 2017 gets underway, it is important to draw the outlines of a "fundamental"
                              economic
                              scenario in the context of an uncertain and potentially anxiety-provoking political
                              environment, thereby isolating the most obvious risks. The new US president Donald
                              Trump may have an aggressive stance in terms of external trade, but only a fraction
                              of the protectionist measures he advocates is ever likely to be implemented. Big changes
                              in tariffs are unlikely. While the funding of a vast infrastructure program is far
                              from settled, President Trump's tax policy as a candidate can be expected to give
                              rise to complex horse-trading, and is likely to be revised downwards. However, fiscal
                              policy is likely to take an expansionary turn. Furthermore, Brexit is not likely to
                              derail the economic scenario: Brexit is only a major problem in that it reflects European
                              political issues; whatever happens, its implementation will be a long process. Stellar
                              in the United States and honourable in the Eurozone, growth is seen as relying on
                              the tireless support of consumers, who are continuing to benefit - to varying degrees,
                              of course - from improvement in the labour market, purchasing power gains and positive
                              wealth effects.
                              </p>
<p>Real growth of 2.3% is forecast in the United States in 2017. The unemployment
                              rate
                              is now below most estimates of its "natural" level of around 4.5-5%. The economy is
                              moving towards full employment, resulting in upward pressure on wages, even though
                              pay increases were slow to take shape, supporting household incomes. Household consumption
                              is expected to remain solid, acting as the main driver of growth in 2017. However,
                              business investment is expected to grow only slightly, and net exports are likely
                              to weigh on growth: the strong dollar and weak growth abroad are dampening US exports
                              at a time when consumer spending is driving imports. The Eurozone, meanwhile, despite
                              the gradual weakening of past support factors (impairment of the euro, weak commodity
                              prices) is projected to grow by 1.5% in 2017. A gradual rebalancing of the sources
                              of growth is emerging: growth is slowing slightly, while remaining above its long-term
                              "potential" trend rate of approximately 1%. Rising commodity prices are easing deflationary
                              pressures and reducing gains in household purchasing power. But they offer businesses
                              better pricing power, which should help boost margins and investment.
                              </p>
<p>This scenario has put long-term interest rates on an upward curve. Gently sloping
                              in the Eurozone, where the ECB, accommodative and active, is still guiding yields
                              for the core countries. Steeper in the US, where the Fed is poised to tighten monetary
                              policy in an environment of accelerating nominal growth. In the United States, expansionary
                              fiscal measures and improving nominal growth prospects are pushing up long-term interest
                              rates, an increase that the markets have already largely priced in since the US elections.
                              In the Eurozone, interest rates are still subject to the influence of the ECB. The
                              economic improvement, the influence of US rates and the tapering or progressive reduction
                              of bond purchases by the ECB from 2018 (at the earliest) will result in higher yields
                              for the core countries. Increases will be slow given the ECB's mechanism and activism,
                              which prevents an abrupt and lasting upturn. We see 10-year rates closing 2017 at
                              around 2.7% in the US and 0.8% in Germany.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, nominal growth and long-term interest rates, diverging monetary policy
                              trends
                              and potential political risks in Europe are a recipe for a moderate appreciation by
                              the dollar.
                              </p>
<p>However, if the scenario of much more expansionary fiscal policy were to materialise
                              in the United States, it would swiftly propel America's nominal growth rate well above
                              trend (2% in real terms, plus a trend inflation rate of 2%). Faster growth of this
                              nature could result in a more significant rise in US long-term rates, triggering a
                              steep appreciation by the dollar and a more aggressive monetary policy from the Fed,
                              especially from 2018. In 2017, the Eurozone is unlikely to be affected by the direct
                              transmission of the US risks to the real economy. Transmission is more likely to come
                              from financial channels: tighter financial and monetary conditions in the United States,
                              resulting in upward pressure on European interest rates compounded by strong pressure
                              from its own political risks (elections in France and in Germany). And it will be
                              up to the ECB alone to bear the heavy task of ensuring minimal visibility, managing
                              interest rates and calming anxious and volatile markets by maintaining an extremely
                              accommodative policy.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB (S.A.) had total assets of €535.5 billion at 31 December 2016,
                              down €30 billion compared with 31 December 2015.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ MONEY MARKET
                              AND INTERBANK ITEMS</h4>
<p>Interbank assets fell by €3.8 billion (-3.7%), with variances of -€7.4 billion
                              euros
                              in deposits with central banks, -€3.4 billion in receivables from credit institutions
                              and +€6.9 billion in government securities, mainly in the trading portfolio.
                              </p>
<p>Interbank liabilities fell by €17.5 billion (-20.9%), with variances of -€12.7
                              billion
                              on repurchase agreements and -€5 billion on term borrowings.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS</h4>
<p>Assets and liabilities decreased respectively by €16.9 billion (-10.5%) and €1.4
                              billion
                              (-1%).
                              </p>
<p>The decline in assets from customer transactions was the result of lower income
                              from
                              repurchase agreements amounting to €20 billion, partly offset by higher customer credits
                              and loans amounting to €3.5 billion.
                              </p>
<p>Among liabilities, loans to customers decreased by €7 billion, while ordinary accounts
                              and repurchase agreements grew respectively by €3.8 billion and €1.9 billion.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
                              AND DEBTS REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY</h4>
<p>Securities transactions were stable on the asset side, but debts securities were
                              down
                              by €4.5 billion (9.8%).
                              </p>
<p>This decrease may be broken down into lower issues of negotiable debt securities
                              issued
                              abroad (-€3 billion) and in France (-€1.5 billion).
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ ACCRUALS, DEFERRED
                              INCOME AND SUNDRY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES</h4>
<p>The accruals and deferred income items mainly record the fair value of derivative
                              instruments. These amounts are reported in "Financial assets and liabilities measured
                              at fair value" in the consolidated financial statements. Accruals were down €9.5 billion
                              on the asset side (-4.7%) and €5.4 billion on the liabilities side (-2.7%), mainly
                              on interest rate swaps.
                              </p>
<p>The "Other assets" and "Other liabilities" items consist primarily of premiums
                              on
                              contingent derivatives and miscellaneous debtors and creditors. Other assets increased
                              by €0.4 billion while Other liabilities decreased by €5.2 billion.
                              </p>
<p>On the asset side, the reduction of €6.9 billion in financial options bought was
                              offset
                              by a €6.6 billion increase in Miscellaneous debtors.
                              </p>
<p>On the liabilities side, the decrease was due to financial instruments sold (€7.7
                              billion) and counterparty transactions (trading securities at €2.8 billion). At the
                              same time, Miscellaneous creditors increased by €3.2 billion and settlement accounts
                              relating to securities transactions by €1.5 billion.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ PROVISIONS
                              AND SUBORDINATED DEBT</h4>
<p>Provisions increased by €1.2 billion (+46.75%). This increase mainly concerned
                              provisions
                              for other risks and expenses (€1.1 billion).
                              </p>
<p>Subordinated debts increased by €1.9 billion (27.73%), including a variance of
                              €1.3
                              billion in fixed-term subordinated debt in Euros and €0.6 billion in undated subordinated
                              debt in Dollars.

<p>The 2016 financial year was once again affected by major volatility in the financial
                              markets due to the many periods of uncertainty over global growth and the highly unusual
                              political situation caused by Brexit, the American Presidential elections and the
                              referendum in Italy.

<p>The end of the year also saw an increase in the American benchmark rates and the
                              continuation
                              of the ECB monetary policy (repurchasing programme right up to December and unchanged

<p>Net banking income for the 2016 financial year reached €3.4 billion, €326 million

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1 CONCISE STATEMENT
                              ON RISKS</h4>
<p>Statement prepared in compliance with Article 435(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.</p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has learned from the 2007/2008 crisis and has considerably
                              reduced
                              its risk appetite, primarily by suspending or cutting back on some of its market activities.
                              Its strategic guidelines and management and control systems have therefore been scaled
                              in such a way as to maintain a controlled risk profile which is adapted to well-thought-out
                              commercial ambitions, a still uncertain economic climate and greater regulation.
                              </p>
<p>The Board of Directors approved Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite for the first
                              time on 30 July 2015. The Board updated it on 11 December 2015, in keeping with Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's 2016 financial goals, and taking into account the new Pillar 2 regulatory
                              constraints effective from 1 January 2016.

                              OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite must be approved by its Board of Directors,
                              following
                              a proposal by Executive Management and after it has been examined by the Board of
                              Directors Risk Committee. Crédit Agricole CIB's risk profile is examined on a regular
                              basis (at least quarterly) by the Risk Committee and by the Board of Directors to
                              ensure that it is still compliant with the risk appetite which has been defined and,
                              where necessary, the risk appetite should be adjusted to be in keeping with changes
                              to the economic climate, regulatory constraints and with Crédit Agricole CIB's commercial
                              and financial goals.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; RISK APPETITE,
                              SPECIFIC RISK STRATEGIES AND SECTOR POLICIES</h4>
<p>Specific risk strategies should be employed for credit, market, operational and
                              non-compliance
                              risks and must be approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP) chaired by
                              Executive Management, by the Group Risk Committee (CRG) chaired by Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. Executive Management for strategies to be authorised at shareholder level, and
                              finally by the Board of Directors (in accordance with the ministerial decree of 3
                              November 2014). The risk strategies are set for each country, business line or sector
                              carrying a significant risk for the Bank within the scope of internal control of Crédit
                              Agricole CIB (see "Objectives and policy" on page 168).
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has also introduced Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) sector
                              policies in cooperation with the Group as a whole to manage the reputational risks
                              stemming from the social and environmental impacts of its activities. These policies
                              set out analysis criteria for these specific risks, which may cause Crédit Agricole
                              CIB not to perform a transaction which displays (or in some cases does not display)
                              certain (required or excluded) characteristics in certain sectors such as armaments,
                              nuclear or coal (see list on page 32). Much like the specific risk strategies, these
                              sector policies are approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP) and then
                              by the Board of Directors.
                              </p>
<p>Ultimately, Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite therefore comprises the following
                              four components which between them form a coherent whole and incorporate the Bank's
                              commercial strategy:

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">RISK TYPES: CHOSEN
                              RISKS AND IMPOSED RISKS</h4>
<p>In order to meet its commercial and financial goals, Crédit Agricole CIB selects
                              the
                              majority of its own risks: counterparty risks, market risks and liquidity risks are
                              taken on intentionally to generate income and profit. Therefore, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              defines its appetite by ensuring that risks are in proportion with its commercial
                              strategy and financial objectives, taking into account its previous performance, competitive
                              position and the current economic cycle, while ensuring that all regulatory requirements
                              (particularly those related to solvency and liquidity) are met.
                              </p>
<p>Other risks such as operational and certain non-compliance risks are essentially
                              imposed,
                              although the implementation of protective measures and control systems helps to manage
                              these risks and their potential consequences. The Bank has no appetite for any intentional
                              act that might generate an operational loss or constitute an infringement of the applicable
                              professional regulations and standards. The Bank's appetite is therefore expressed
                              through certain control and watch list indicators, whose purpose is to reduce the
                              impact of these risks to a bare minimum.

<p>Short-term liquidity stress is applied based on crisis scenarios that Crédit Agricole
                              CIB believes that it could face should an event affect the Group (idiosyncratic crisis),
                              the whole of the interbank market (systemic crisis), or a combination of the two (global
                              crisis).
                              </p>
<p>The stable funding position, defined as a long-term surplus of resources over long-term
                              assets, aims to protect business lines from the consequences of market stress. LCR
                              came into force on 31 October 2015. This ratio requires the Bank to retain sufficient
                              unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily
                              and immediately, on private markets, assuming a liquidity crisis lasting 30 calendar
                              days.
                              </p>
<p>At 31 December 2016, all of these indicators were compliant with the Bank's tolerance
                              in this area. Note that the LCR percentage of 118% far exceeds the regulatory requirement
                              of 70%.

                              AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS LINES
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; CREDIT</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's Corporate and Investment Banking is based on debt-related
                              business:
                              credit risk is therefore central to its activities and is by far the greatest risk.
                              Like Crédit Agricole CIB's competitors, CIB customers are often large multinationals
                              or major financial institutions which by their very nature, in addition to individual
                              creditworthiness issues, generate a concentration risk in this area. This risk should
                              however be put into perspective by viewing the Crédit Agricole Group as a whole. The
                              refocusing strategy applied since the financial crisis slightly reduced the number
                              of counterparties and geographical sites, and therefore resulted in a relative increase
                              in the portfolio concentration. However the Bank is still active in a large number
                              of countries and economic sectors, thus benefiting from the positive effect of sectoral
                              and geographical diversification. This effect is measured and monitored under ICAAP.
                              On the other hand, Crédit Agricole CIB's Wealth Management (WM) business line generates
                              few credit risks, as the majority of its services are Lombard loans which are secured
                              against collateral such as: cash, securities, life insurance contracts, etc.
                              </p>
<p>Therefore, Crédit Agricole CIB's risk appetite is defined in accordance with three
                              key indicators:

                              activity and the resulting risk. This redimensioning plan followed the response to
                              the financial crises of 2007-2008, and then 2011, and the choice to discontinue activities
                              which were deemed to be non-strategic or below their critical size. Thus, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB disposed of the European (Cheuvreux) and Asian (CLSA) equity brokers, together
                              with its 50% stake in Newedge Group (derivatives brokerage). It also ceased its commodity-related
                              activities, stepped down from its market-making role for credit derivatives and closed
                              the majority of its equity derivative activities. The Bank also suspended its own-account
                              activities and, under the French Banking Law (LBF), was not required to set up an
                              ad-hoc subsidiary. Finally, the Bank's Treasury Department is responsible for the
                              sound and prudent management of cash, as required under the LBF.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has retained its appetite for market risks in its CIB activities,
                              when such risks are adopted by supplying corporate customers and financial institutions
                              with the investment products and services that they require (including some structured
                              products), and by assuming its role as a market maker for certain market segments
                              and instruments. Wealth Management on the other hand is only exposed to a very low
                              level of market risks.
                              </p>
<p>Therefore, Crédit Agricole CIB's market risk appetite is defined in accordance
                              with
                              two key indicators:

                              of credit risks, market risks, country and portfolios risks, operational risks and
                              accounting risks. Crédit Agricole CIB's Risk Management and Permanent Controls organisation
                              is integrated into the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group's Risk Management and Permanent

                              </p>
<p>Risk management is delegated to Crédit Agricole CIB under formally adopted subsidiarity
                              and delegation principles. Within this framework, the RPC regularly reports its major
                              risks to Crédit Agricole S.A.'s Group Risk Management Division, and has Crédit Agricole
                              S.A.'s Group Risk Committee (CRG) approve those cases which exceed its authorised
                              limits as well as substantial risk strategies at the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group level.

<p>Anticipation of the potential deterioration of counterparties is specifically assessed

                              to the Central Management Department. The purpose of these meetings is to identify
                              early signs of potential deterioration of counterparties hitherto considered sound.
                              After a review of the information gathered, these meetings are intended to draw the
                              most appropriate operational consequences from the review, depending on whether its
                              conclusions are positive (signs ultimately considered innocuous or benign, not justifying
                              at this stage a challenge to the customer) or negative (confirmation of concern necessarily
                              resulting in a reduction of our risk exposure).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2.2 CREDIT RISKS</h4>
<p>A credit risk occurs when a counterparty is unable to fulfil its obligations and
                              when
                              the book value of these obligations in the bank's records is positive. The counterparty
                              may be a bank, an industrial or commercial corporate, a government or government entity,
                              an investment fund or an individual. The exposure may be a loan, debt security, deed
                              of property, performance exchange contract, guarantee or unused confirmed commitment.
                              The risk also includes the settlement risk inherent in any transaction entailing an
                              exchange of cash or physical goods outside a secure settlement system.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ 2.2.1 OBJECTIVES
                              AND POLICY</h4>
<p>Risk-taking in Crédit Agricole CIB is done through the definition of risk strategies
                              approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP), chaired by Executive Management.
                              The risk strategies are set for each country, business/product line or sector carrying
                              a significant risk for the Bank within the scope of control of Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              The strategies define the boundaries within which each business line or geographical
                              entity must conduct its activities, and cover: included (or excluded) industrial sectors,
                              type of counterparty, nature and duration of transactions and activities or authorised
                              product types, category or intensity of risks incurred, existence and value of guarantees,
                              overall portfolio volume, definition of individual and overall risk level, diversification
                              criteria.
                              </p>
<p>By establishing a risk strategy for each scope deemed significant by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, each business sector and each country, the Bank is able to define its risk appetite
                              and quality criteria for the commitments that it subsequently makes. It also prevents
                              from excessive concentrations and it leads to a risk diversification of the portfolio
                              profile.
                              </p>
<p>Concentration risks are managed by using specific indicators that are taken into
                              account
                              for granting loans (individual concentration model, capital allocation in the RAROC).
                              Concentrations are then monitored a posteriori for the affected portfolios, by analysing
                              the quantitative measure assigned to this use, based on the Bank's internal model.
                              </p>
<p>Finally, an active portfolio management is done within Crédit Agricole CIB to reduce
                              main concentration risks and also to optimise its uses of shareholders' equity. The
                              ALM/CPM uses market instruments such as credit derivatives or securitisation mechanisms
                              to reduce and diversify counterparty risks. The use of derivatives to manage credit
                              risk entails the purchase of credit derivatives on single exposures (see "Credit risk
                              -Use of credit derivatives" in the "Risk factors and Pillar 3" chapter), and the sale
                              of credit derivatives for diversification purposes and the sale of senior exposure
                              tranches to reduce the sensitivity of the insurance portfolio (it should be noted
                              that these reinvestment transactions, whether singly or in tranches, are in attrition).
                              Similarly, potential risk concentration is mitigated by the syndication of loans with
                              external banks and the use of risk hedging instruments (credit insurance, derivatives,
                              etc.).

                              RISK MANAGEMENT</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; GENERAL PRINCIPLES
                              OF RISK-TAKING</h4>
<p>Credit decisions depend on the upstream risk strategies that are defined above.</p>
<p>Limits are set for all counterparties and groups of counterparties, in order to
                              control
                              the amount of commitments, whatever the type of counterparty (corporate, sovereign,
                              banks, financial institutions, local authorities, SPEs, etc.). Authorisations vary
                              according to the quality of the risk, assessed by an internal rating of the counterparty.
                              The credit decision must form part of the formally approved risk strategies.
                              </p>
<p>Second-level controls on compliance with limits are performed by the "Risk and
                              Permanent
                              Control" Department, supplemented by a process for monitoring individual and portfolio
                              risks, notably to detect any deterioration in the quality of counterparties and Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's commitments as early as possible.
                              </p>
<p>Where the risk is substantiated, a collective and specific impairment policy is
                              put
                              into effect.
                              </p>
<p>New transactions are approved according to a decision-making process based on two
                              front-office signatures, one from a collaborator authorised to make such a request
                              and the other from a delegate empowered to make a credit decision.
                              </p>
<p>The decision is supported by an independent opinion by the RPC approved by an authorised
                              RPC signatory and must take Basel II parameters into account, including the internal
                              rating of the counterparty and the predictive Loss Given Default (LGD) attributed
                              to the proposed transactions. A calculation of ex ante profitability must also be
                              included in the credit file. In the event that the risk management team's opinion
                              is negative, the decision-making power is passed up to Front-Office delegate the chairman
                              of the immediate higher committee.

                              AND ASSESSMENT METHODS AND SYSTEMS</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">INTERNAL RATING
                              SYSTEM</h4>
<p>The internal rating system covers all methods, procedures and controls used to
                              calculate
                              credit risk, borrower ratings and loss given default figures for all of our exposures.
                              In 2007, Crédit Agricole CIB received authorisation from the French Regulatory and
                              Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR) to use its internal credit risk rating system
                              to calculate regulatory capital requirements.
                              </p>
<p>The methods used cover all types of counterparty and combine quantitative and qualitative
                              criteria. They are devised using the expertise of the various financing activities
                              within Crédit Agricole CIB, or within the Crédit Agricole Group if they cover customers
                              shared by the whole Group. The rating scale has 15 notches. It has been established
                              on the basis of a segmentation of risk so as to provide a uniform view of default
                              risk over a full business cycle. The scale comprises 13 ratings (A+ to E-) for counterparties
                              that are not in default (including 3 ratings for counterparties that have been placed
                              under watch) and 2 ratings (F and Z) for counterparties that are in default.
                              </p>
<p>The relevance of ratings and reliability of data used are secured by a process
                              of
                              initial validation and maintenance of internal models, based on a structured and documented
                              organisation applied to the Group and involving the entities, the Risk and Permanent
                              Control Department and the Audit-Inspection business line.
                              </p>
<p>All internal models used by Crédit Agricole CIB were the subject of a presentation
                              to the Standards and Methodology Committee (CNM) for approval before internal validation
                              by the Control and Audit function. They were also the subject of a validation by the
                              ACPR on 1 January 2008. Furthermore, each change in the internal model is now subject
                              to an audit by the validation team within the Group Risk Management Department before
                              being presented to the CNM for approval.
                              </p>
<p>Corporates' internal rating is followed according to a system common to Crédit
                              Agricole
                              Group; guaranteeing a uniform rating throughout the Group and enabling to share backtesting
                              work for common customers. Crédit Agricole CIB has ensured that the risk parameters
                              required by Basel II, allowing the calculation of capital requirements, are used as
                              part of the Bank's internal management. They are used by all people involved in the
                              process of granting loans and measuring and monitoring credit risks.
                              </p>
<p>The data used for granting loans and determining ratings is monitored every two
                              months
                              by a Basel Requirements Review Committee. This committee is coordinated by the Risk
                              Management Department, and representatives of all business lines take part in it.
                              The committee monitors a set of indicators concerning the quality of data used for
                              rating purposes, as well as the calculation of other Basel II parameters when granting
                              loans, such as loss given default (LGD), credit conversion factor (CCF), risk reduction
                              factor (RRF), etc. The committee helps business lines apply Basel II requirements
                              and, if necessary, to take remedial action when discrepancies arise. It provides important
                              help in checking that the Basel II system is used properly by the business lines.

<p>Backtesting aims to ensure the robustness, performance and predictive power of
                              the
                              Bank's internal models over time. This exercise also helps detecting significant changes
                              in the structure and behaviour of portfolios and clients. It then leads to adjustment
                              decisions adjustment, or even recast, of models in order to take into account these
                              new structural elements.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the backtesting methods of the "Probability of default" (PD) scope were
                              reviewed
                              and approved by the CNM, in response to recommendations issued by the Group's Internal
                              Audit and Risk Management departments. On the backtesting of PD parameter, the following
                              analyses are carried out:

<p>For models under its responsibility, Crédit Agricole CIB gets back annually to

                              Group, through the Committee of Backtesting on the one hand and the CNM on the other

                              statistical methods and the validity of results. The summary document recommends,
                              where necessary, appropriate corrective measures (methodology review, recalibration,
                              training effort, control recommendations, etc.).
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT</h4>
<p>The measurement of credit risk exposures includes both drawn facilities and confirmed
                              unutilised facilities. To measure counterparty risk on capital markets transactions,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB uses an internal method for estimating the underlying risk of
                              derivative financial instruments such as swaps and structured products.
                              </p>
<p>Counterparty risks on capital market activities are assessed for potential risk
                              linked
                              to fluctuations in the market value of derivative instruments for the remainder of
                              their life. This is determined according to the nature and remaining maturity of agreements,
                              based on a statistical observation of changes to underlyings. When the netting and
                              collateralisation agreements with the counterparty allow, counterparty risk is measured
                              for the portfolio net of eligible collateral. The Corporate and Investment business
                              uses this method for the internal management of counterparty risk, and it differs
                              from the regulatory approach used to meet the measurement requirements of European,
                              and international capital adequacy ratios or for reporting major risks.
                              </p>
<p>To reduce exposure to counterparty risks, the Corporate and Investment business
                              enters
                              into netting and collateralisation agreements with its counterparties (see part 2.2.4
                              "Credit risk mitigation mechanism").

                              risks for its overall portfolio and for each of the constituent subportfolios, according
                              to a breakdown by business line, sector, geographic zone, or any delineation that
                              brings out specific risk characteristics in the overall portfolio.
                              </p>
<p>In principle, portfolio reviews are conducted yearly on each significant scope

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB uses credit risk modelling tools and in particular an internal
                              portfolio model that calculates risk indicators such as: average loss, volatility
                              of potential losses and economic capital. Average loss and volatility figures enable
                              Crédit Agricole CIB to anticipate the average risk-related cost in its portfolio,
                              and changes therein. Economic capital is an additional measurement of Basel II regulatory
                              capital, to the extent that it allows a more detailed view of the portfolio through
                              a correlation model and parameters calibrated using internal data bases. The internal
                              portfolio model also takes into account the impact of protection (Credit Default Swaps,
                              securitisations) purchased by Crédit Agricole CIB's Credit Portfolio Management unit.
                              Finally, it measures the effects of concentration and diversification within our portfolio.
                              These effects are studied based on individual and geo-sectorial criteria. Stress scenarios
                              are the final type of counterparty risk assessment tool. They are regularly produced
                              to estimate the impact of economic scenarios (central, adverse) on some or all parts
                              of the portfolio.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">SECTOR RISKS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's portfolio is analysed by major industrial sector at regular
                              intervals, at least once a quarter. Risks within each sector in terms of commitments,
                              level of risk (expected loss, economic capital) and concentration are examined. Concentration
                              is assessed on two levels: idiosyncratic and geo-sectorial. These analyses can be
                              more or less deepened according to the analyst's needs.
                              </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the economic and financial risks of each significant sector are analysed
                              and leading indicators of deterioration are monitored.
                              </p>
<p>Specific stress scenarios are also prepared when necessary for instance during
                              the
                              strategic review of an entity of the Bank. In the light of these various analyses,
                              measures to diversify or protect sectors at risk of deterioration are recommended.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">COUNTRY RISKS</h4>
<p>Country risk is the risk that economic, financial, political, legal or social conditions
                              of a foreign country will affect the Bank's financial interests. It does not differ
                              in nature from "elementary" risks (credit, market and operational risks). It constitutes
                              a set of risks resulting from the Bank's vulnerability to a specific political, social,
                              macroeconomic and financial environment.
                              </p>
<p>The system for assessing and monitoring country risk within Crédit Agricole CIB
                              is
                              based on an internal rating model. Internal country ratings are based on criteria
                              relating to the financial soundness of the government, the banking system and the
                              economy, ability and willingness to pay, governance and political stability.

                              modelling of the change in underlying market parameters. The model also takes into
                              account various risk mitigation factors, linked to set-off and collateralisation contracts
                              negotiated with counterparties during the pre-transaction documentation phase.

                              as a result of a legal tie between this counterparty and the underlying of the derivative)
                              are monitored regularly to identify and integrate such risks in the exposure measurement
                              as recommended by regulations. Situations of general risk of unfavourable correlations
                              (risk that market conditions have a correlated effect on a counterparty's credit quality
                              and derivative exposures with this counterparty) are monitored by means of ad hoc
                              exercises in 2016. The internal model is used to manage internal limits on transactions
                              with each counterparty and to calculate Basel II Pillar 2 economic capital via the
                              average risk profile (Expected Positive Exposure) using a global portfolio approach.
                              </p>
<p>As allowed by the regulatory framework, the French Regulatory and resolution supervisory
                              authority (ACPR) authorised Crédit Agricole CIB as of 31 March 2014 to use the internal
                              model method to calculate its capital requirements in respect of counterparty risk.
                              This method uses the model described above to determine Effective Expected Positive
                              Exposure (EEPE) and is applied to all derivatives. The same method is used to calculate
                              credit exposure at default for capital requirement purposes to address the risk of
                              credit value adjustment (CVA). For repo transactions and derivative transactions at
                              its subsidiaries, Crédit Agricole CIB uses the standard approach.
                              </p>
<p>Credit risk on these market transactions is managed following rules set by the
                              Group.
                              The policy on setting counterparty risk limits is as described in "Credit risk management
                              - General principles of risk-taking" on page 169. The techniques used by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB to reduce counterparty risk on market transactions are described in "Credit risk
                              mitigation mechanisms" on pages 249 and 250.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB includes a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in its calculation
                              of the fair value of derivative assets. This value adjustment is described in Note
                              1.3 to the consolidated financial statements under accounting principles and policies
                              and Note 10.2 on Information about financial instruments measured at fair value (see

                              loans that have been subject to forbearance measures, as defined in Annex V of the
                              Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014. A pre-identification is made
                              first, during the loan approval process, when Crédit Agricole CIB studies the clients'
                              requests for credit restructuring. Once the forbearance measure is implemented, the
                              outstanding loans in forbearance are declared under that designation, regardless their
                              internal rating or their accounting treatment.
                              </p>

<p>Sensitive cases, whether cases "under Special Supervision" or bad debts, are managed

                              on a quarterly basis under the chairmanship of the head of Risk and Permanent Control
                              - Sensitive Cases and Impairment - in order to proceed with a cross-examination of
                              these loans' classifications as doubtful or sensitive cases, to determine the potential

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; STRESS SCENARIOS</h4>
<p>Credit stress tests are devised to assess the potential impact the Bank may face
                              (in
                              terms of loss, provisioning and capital) in the event of a serious deterioration in
                              the economic and financial environment.
                              </p>
<p>There are three types of stress test categories:</p>
<table cellpadding="0mm" class="list_table_ul">

                              on the solvency ratio. Such scenario is mandatory in order to comply with the needs
                              of a strengthened prudential supervision required by the Pillar 2 of Basel II. Since
                              2014, this has been led by the ECB and the EBA, with the aim of testing the financial
                              solidity of the banks and/or the banking system as a whole. Since 2016, the results
                              of the regulatory stress tests are taken into account in the calibration of capital
                              requirements under Pillar 2;

                              AND GUARANTEES RECEIVED</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB requires guarantees and collateral from a significant number

                              its counterparties to reduce its risks, either on financing or market transactions.
                              </p>
<p>The principles for accepting under Basel II, taking into account and managing guarantees
                              and collateral are defined by the Crédit Agricole Group's Standards and Methodology

                              AGREEMENTS</h4>
<p>With the implementation of the recommendations of Basel Committee along with the
                              CRD
                              IV European Directive on regulatory capital, the French Prudential Supervisory and
                              Resolution Authority (ACPR) requires that several conditions have to be strictly respected
                              in order to trigger a close out netting within the framework of determining the regulatory
                              shareholder's equity of a financial institution. These conditions include: Crédit
                              Agricole CIB obtaining recent written and reasoned legal opinions as well as proceedings
                              "in order to ensure at any time the validity of the novation settlement or the netting
                              agreement in the event that applicable regulations are revised".
                              </p>
<p>The close out netting corresponds to the possibility, in case of default from the
                              counterparty (including the case of an opening of a bankruptcy proceeding) of early
                              cancelling the contract and calculating a full settlement of debts and reciprocal
                              obligations according to a calculus method that would have been contractually worked
                              out. Thus, the close out netting is an anticipated termination-compensation mechanism
                              which can be separated in three steps:

<p>The collateral (or collateralisation) corresponds to a financial guarantee mechanism

                              that could be netted in case of a default from a counterparty, in order to determine
                              the full settlement of debts and reciprocal obligations resulting from a master agreement
                              that would have been signed with the counterparty. The implementation of the close

                              </p>
<p>Part of the growth of commitments in certain sectors is linked to the appreciation
                              of the US dollar, due to the fact that a significant portion of transactions are denominated
                              in US dollars (Oil &amp; Gas, Shipping, Aircraft).
                              </p>
<p>Outstanding amounts with banks are still primarily focused on the central banks
                              of

                              2016, our Bank of Japan exposure had fallen significantly. This represents €5.6 billion,
                              compared to €10.6 billion at the end of December 2015.

                              incorporates a highly diverse range of underlyings, companies and financing types,
                              including a number of sub-segments such as RBL, trade and project finance which are
                              usually secured by assets. Most of our exposure in the oil sector relates to players
                              that are structurally less sensitive to the drop in oil prices (public sector companies,
                              large international companies, transportation/storage/refinery companies). On the
                              other hand, customers with a focus on exploration/ production, and those reliant on
                              investment levels in the industry (oil-related services), are the worst affected.
                              They have been the subject of specific monitoring throughout the year, and have specific
                              procedures to follow: reduction in commitments on the exploration/production sub-portfolio,
                              stability of commitments on the oil-related services subportfolio, as well as resistance
                              tests using extremely conservative oil price hypotheses. Generally speaking, the "Oil
                              &amp; Gas" sector benefits from a very selective approach to projects and any significant
                              new operations are subject to in-depth analysis. Our exposure (expressed on the basis
                              of EAD), which represents 1.7% of the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group's EAD has fallen

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; COUNTRY RISK
                              POLICY</h4>
<p>2016 was marked by a number of events that will potentially have an impact on the
                              future. In particular, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as President of the
                              United States, the full consequences of which are yet to be seen, mean that early
                              2017 has been shrouded in uncertainty. We have already witnessed the return of a certain
                              protectionism, a "redealing" of the geopolitical cards, particularly with the enhanced
                              presence of Russia and China on the international scene, and the gradual rebuilding
                              of zones of influence.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, the Bank reviewed its strategies and limits for 63 countries in which
                              it
                              serves its customers, as well as 22 business lines and 9 sector policies. It also
                              reviewed 31 country portfolios and 8 business lines, and updated country ratings quarterly.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">OUTLOOK FOR 2017</h4>
<p>With regard to the growth plan, the IMF forecasts a minor improvement in global
                              growth,
                              from 3.1% in 2016 to 3.4% in 2017, representing an increase of 1.9% for developed
                              countries and 4.5% for emerging economies. However, world trade remains in a structural
                              slowdown (deceleration in China, recession in a number of major emerging economies
                              [Brazil, Russia, South Africa, etc.]) and is not expected to exceed the 3% growth
                              that we have seen for the past five years. This is notably due to the facts that consumers
                              are demanding more services than goods and that political risk, and protectionism
                              in particular, are heightened. Lastly, overall private and public debt has already
                              exceeded 325% of world GDP and its viability could be under threat from rising borrowing
                              costs.
                              </p>
<p>Against this potentially more favourable backdrop, Crédit Agricole will continue
                              to
                              maintain its active role vis-à-vis its local and international customers and will
                              continue to help them develop their businesses both at home and abroad, whilst ensuring
                              that all applicable regulations are complied with.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">EVOLUTION OF THE
                              EXPOSURE REGARDING EMERGING COUNTRIES</h4>
<p>Commercial exposures at 31 December 2016 to countries with lower than a 'B' rating,
                              excluding downgraded countries in Western Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece,
                              Cyprus and Iceland) totalled €40.3 billion (including the UBAF portion), an increase
                              of 11% compared to the end of 2015. This increase was mainly due to the business development
                              in Asia: +€2.7 billion - mainly in China but also, to a lesser extent, the Gulf countries:
                              +€1 billion. This upward trend is set to continue in 2017 based on an upturn in world
                              growth.
                              </p>
<p>The concentration of outstandings to countries with lower than a 'B' rating, excluding
                              downgraded countries in Western Europe and UBAF, remained stable relative to end-2015,
                              with 97% of Crédit Agricole CIB's portfolio concentrated on 33 countries, of which
                              12 accounted for 85% of the total.
                              </p>
<p>In 2016, excluding downgraded countries in Western Europe, the portfolio breakdown
                              by country category posted a marked deterioration, with the share of the portfolio
                              in countries with "Investment Grade" status decreasing from 79% (end-2015) to 69%
                              (end-2016). This downturn is linked to Brazil's loss of investment grade status during
                              the second quarter of 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The portfolio for the corresponding country scope remains highly concentrated on
                              two
                              regions: Asia and the Middle East, representing 65% of this portfolio.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">ASIA</h4>
<p>Asia is still the region with the highest exposure, with outstanding amounts of
                              €15
                              billion, or 37% of the commercial exposure for the corresponding country scope. This
                              amount is up 22% compared to the previous year and is primarily linked to the business
                              developments in China and, to a lesser extent, India.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">MIDDLE EAST AND
                              NORTH AFRICA</h4>
<p>The Middle East and North Africa region has the second highest risk exposure of
                              the
                              corresponding country scope with 28% of outstandings (€11.3 billion), representing
                              an increase of 9.5% compared to the previous year. This increase is largely due to
                              the increased outstandings in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
                              and Qatar remain the countries with the highest exposures.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">LATIN AMERICA</h4>
<p>This region represents 19% of the portfolio for the corresponding country scope,
                              or
                              €7.5 billion, a decrease of 7% from the previous year, mainly due to the reduction
                              in outstandings in Brazil. The portfolio is still focused primarily on Brazil and
                              Mexico.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CENTRAL AND EASTERN
                              EUROPE</h4>
<p>The share of the Central &amp; Eastern Europe region is up compared to the previous
                              year
                              (+10%), with outstandings of €4.3 billion (11% of the portfolio), principally concentrated
                              in Russia.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA</h4>
<p>At the end of December 2016, this region represented 5.5% of the commercial portfolio
                              for the corresponding country scope, or €2.2 billion, an increase of 26% on the previous
                              year. More than half of this relates to South Africa.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2.3 MARKET RISKS</h4>

<p>The entire system is placed under the authority of the Market Risk Committee. The
                              committee, chaired by the Executive Management of Crédit Agricole CIB, meets twice
                              a month. It monitors and analyses market risk and corresponding trends. It ensures
                              compliance with monitoring indicators, specific management rules and defined limits.
                              It sets limits for operating divisions within the overall budget set by the Strategies
                              and Portfolios Committee. In addition, Crédit Agricole S.A.'s Group Risk Committee
                              (CRG) sets overall limits.
                              </p>
<p>The Market Risk Committee comprises members of Crédit Agricole CIB's Executive
                              Committee,
                              a representative member of the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Department, the heads
                              of Market Risk Management and the operating heads of Market Activities.

<p>The Liquidity Risk Committee, chaired by Crédit Agricole CIB's Executive Management,
                              meets twice a month. It monitors and analyses liquidity risk and corresponding trends.
                              It ensures compliance with monitoring indicators, specific management rules and defined
                              limits and the proper application of Group standards.
                              </p>
<p>The committee comprises in particular Crédit Agricole CIB's Executive Management,

                              AFFECTING THE DRM'S SCOPE</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB continued its work on rolling out a Market Risk ecosystem to
                              meet
                              the requirements of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book that is also compatible
                              with BCBS 2S9. The project is broken down into various subprojects relating to business
                              line organisation (the boundary between trading and banking books, defining trading
                              desks, eligibility for internal approach), calculating indicators (implementing the
                              internal model alongside the standard method, risk factors that cannot be modelled,
                              calculating Expected Shortfalls), automation and mass validation of indicators based
                              around a data-centred information system.
                              </p>
<p>The implementation of a calculation of the initial margin for non-cleared derivatives
                              started as planned on 1 September 2016 with American, Canadian and Japanese counterparties
                              according to the thresholds in force. The business scope will be extended to European
                              counterparties in progressive phases depending on notional amounts, extending into
                              2020.

                              RISK (VaR)</h4>
<p>VaR is calculated daily on all positions. It represents the potential future loss
                              with a 99% confidence interval. Since VaR does not recognise extreme market conditions,
                              it should not be confused with the concept of maximum loss. Stressed VaR and stress
                              scenarios are used in addition to this system in order to measure these extreme risks.

<p>Graph No 1 (see below) shows Crédit Agricole CIB's VaR trend for the regulatory
                              scope
                              in 2016. In 2016, regulatory VaR averaged €12.8 million (slightly up on an average
                              of €12 million in 2015) and ranged between a lower limit of €8.1 million and an upper
                              limit of €17.2 million (see table below).

                              REGULATORY VaR STATISTICS</h4>
<p>If the historical data used to calculate VaR shocks originate in low-volatility
                              market
                              situations, the resulting VaR will have a low level. To compensate for this pro-cyclical
                              bias, the regulator introduced the stressed VaR.
                              </p>
<p>Stressed VaR is calculated using the "initial" VaR model for a confidence interval
                              of 99% and a one-day horizon, and over a period of stress that corresponds to the
                              most severe period for the most significant risk factors. This stress period is recalibrated
                              each year.

<p>Graph No 4 (overleaf) shows the changes in Crédit Agricole CIB's stressed regulatory
                              VaR over the 2015-2016 period. In 2016, the main increases in the stressed VaR were
                              due to variations in positions, mainly in Foreign Exchange and Rates. It should be
                              noted that the change in the stressed VaR period occurring in early July did not have
                              a significant impact. The stressed VaR in 2016 was comparable to those of 2015, as
                              shown by the statistical table below, in line with Crédit Agricole CIB's prudent management
                              policy.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; CVA VaR STATISTICS</h4>
<p>CRD IV introduced a new capital charge to reflect Credit Value Adjustment (CVA)
                              volatility,
                              i.e. a valuation adjustment on assets known as CVA Risk, whose purpose is to recognise
                              credit events affecting our counterparties in the valuation of OTC derivatives. As
                              such, CVA is defined as the difference between the valuation without default risk
                              and the valuation that takes into account the probability of default of our counterparties.
                              </p>
<p>Under this directive, institutions authorised to calculate their capital requirements
                              using the internal model for counterparty risks and as regards specific interest rate
                              risk must calculate their CVA risk capital charge using the advanced method ("CVA
                              VaR"). This method is calculated on the basis of expected positive exposures on trades
                              of OTC derivatives with "Financial Institutions" processed by Crédit Agricole CIB
                              (parent company) and its branches, excluding intra-Group trades. Lastly, the system
                              used to estimate the capital requirements is the same as the one used to calculate
                              the market VaR for the specific interest rate risk.
                              </p>
<p>The French Prudential supervisory and control authority (ACPR) validated the CVA
                              VaR
                              model, and with the entry into force of CRD IV (Basel III) from 1 January 2014, the
                              additional capital required in connection with the CVA (VaR and stressed VaR) is now
                              calculated.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; STRESS TESTS</h4>
<p>Stress tests were developed to assess the ability of financial institutions to
                              withstand
                              a shock to their activities. This shock may be economic (economic downturn for example)
                              or geopolitical (conflict between countries).
                              </p>
<p>To satisfy regulatory requirements and complete its VaR measurements, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB thus applies stress scenarios to its market activities in order to determine the
                              impact of particularly strong (and unpredictable or difficult to categorise) disruptions
                              on the value of its accounts. These scenarios are developed using three complementary
                              approaches:

                              RELATED TO THE IRC, STANDARD METHOD</h4>
<p>The Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) is an additional capital requirement on so-called
                              linear credit positions (i.e. excluding credit correlation positions), required by
                              the regulator in CRD III following the subprime crisis.
                              </p>
<p>The purpose of the IRC is to quantify unexpected losses caused by credit events
                              affecting
                              issuers, i.e. defaults or rating migrations (both upgrades and downgrades). In other
                              words, the IRC recognises two risk measures:
                              </p>
<p>1. Default risk (potential gains and losses due to the default of the issuer);</p>
<p>2. Migration risk, which represents potential gains and losses following a migration
                              of the issuer's credit rating and the impact of related spreads.
                              </p>
<p>The IRC is calculated with a confidence interval of 99.9% over a one-year risk
                              horizon
                              using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated default and credit migration scenarios
                              are then valued using Crédit Agricole CIB pricing models. The range of Mark-to-Market
                              valuations provides a distribution, from which a 99.9% confidence level calculation
                              makes it possible to determine the IRC.
                              </p>
<p>At the end of December 2016, the capital requirements related to the IRC totalled
                              €127 million.

                              RELATED TO PRUDENT VALUATION</h4>
<p>In accordance with CRD IV, the Basel III Committee requires that each bank calculate
                              a "prudent valuation" on the assumption that fair value recognition does not always
                              provide a prudent measure. The purpose of the prudent valuation is therefore to define
                              a detailed framework of independent accounting standards making it possible to value
                              all trading and banking book positions recognised at fair value with a 90% confidence
                              interval.
                              </p>
<p>Prudent valuation is defined as a set of nine additional valuation adjustments
                              (AVA):
                              market price uncertainty, close-out costs, model risk, concentrated positions, unearned
                              credit spreads, investing and funding costs, early termination, future administrative
                              costs and operational risks. All of these various categories are then aggregated and
                              deducted from Common Equity Tier 1.
                              </p>
<p>The calculation of valuation adjustments based on regulatory requirements had an
                              impact

                              AND POLICY</h4>
<p>Global interest-rate risk management aims to protect commercial margins against
                              rate
                              variations and to ensure a better stability over time of the equity and long-term
                              financing components' intrinsic value.
                              </p>
<p>The intrinsic value and the interest margin are linked to the sensitivity in the
                              interest-rate
                              variation of the net present value and in cash flow variation of the financial instruments
                              in the on and off balance sheet. This sensitivity arises when assets and liabilities
                              have different maturities and dates for interest-rate refixing.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; EXPOSURE</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's risk exposure to interest rate risk on retail operations
                              is
                              limited because of the rate backing rule for each instance of customer financing by
                              Treasury and market teams.
                              </p>
<p>The interest rate risk mainly comes from capital, investments, modelling of unpaid
                              liabilities, and from maturities under one year of the banking book's Treasury activities.
                              </p>
<p>The Group is mainly exposed to the Euro zone and, to a lesser extent US Dollar,
                              interest
                              rate variation.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB manages its interest rate risk exposure within a range defined
                              by Crédit Agricole S.A.: €8 billion up to 2 years, €1.5 billion up to 3 years, €1.25
                              billion up to 4 years, €1 billion up to 5 years, and €0.75 billion up to 10 years.
                              Crédit Agricole CIB also has an overall limit in Net Present Value (NPV) all currencies
                              defined by Crédit Agricole S.A. amounting to €350 million.
                              </p>
<p>Interest-rate gaps measure the surplus or deficit of fixed-rate resources. Conventionally,
                              a positive gap represents an exposure to a risk of falling interest rates during the
                              period. The results of these measurements at 31 December 2016 reflect that Crédit
                              Agricole CIB is exposed to a fall in interest rates.

<p>In terms of net banking income sensitivity for the first year (2017), Crédit Agricole
                              CIB could earn €0.13 million of revenues in case of a long-lasting 200-basis-point
                              decrease in the interest rates, that is to say a 0.003% sensitivity for a reference
                              net banking income of €4,936 million in 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Based on these same sensitivity calculations, the net present value of the loss
                              incurred
                              in the next ten years in the event of an adverse 200-basis-point movement in the yield
                              curve equals less than 0.64% of the Group's prudential capital.

<p>Simulations are made using the sensitivity of Crédit Agricole CIB's interest-rate
                              mismatch. Sensitivity is defined as the gain or loss arising from a 2% change in interest
                              rates. This sensitivity is calculated in EUR and USD. The calculation is based on
                              average outstandings.
                              </p>
<p>The shocks contained in these scenarios are calculated on a 10-day basis, according
                              to Crédit Agricole CIB's stress scenario methodology. Sensitivity is "shocked" in
                              various ways. The result of a stress test corresponds to the net present value of
                              changes in the scenario's characteristics. These stress scenarios display relatively
                              limited impacts, since the net present value of the maximum potential loss equalled
                              0.31% of accounting capital and 1.40% of net banking income at 31 December 2016.

                              EXCHANGE RISK</h4>
<p>Currency risk is assessed mainly by measuring net residual exposure, taking into
                              account
                              gross foreign exchange positions and hedging.

                              EXCHANGE-RATE RISK</h4>
<p>The Group's structural exchange-rate risk results from its other than temporary
                              investments
                              in assets denominated in foreign currencies, mainly the equity of its foreign operating
                              entities, whether they result from acquisitions, transfers of funds from head office
                              or the capitalisation of local earnings.
                              </p>
<p>In most cases, the Group's policy is to borrow the currency in which the investment
                              is made in order to immunise that investment from currency risk. These borrowings
                              are documented as investment hedging instruments. In some cases, particularly for
                              illiquid currencies, the investment gives rise to sales and purchases of the local
                              currency. Foreign exchange risk is then hedged, if possible, through forward transactions.
                              </p>
<p>Overall, the Group's main gross structural foreign exchange positions are denominated
                              in US dollars, in US dollar-linked currencies (mainly Middle Eastern and some Asian
                              currencies), in sterling and in Swiss franc.
                              </p>
<p>The Group's policy for managing structural foreign exchange positions aims at achieving
                              two main goals:

                              AND FINANCING RISK</h4>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB Group is, like all credit institutions, exposed to the
                              risk
                              of not having sufficient funds to honour its commitments. This risk could for example
                              be realised in the event of a mass withdrawal of customer or investor deposits or
                              during a confidence crisis or even a general liquidity crisis in the market (access
                              to interbank, monetary and bond markets).
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; OBJECTIVES
                              AND POLICY</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's first goal in terms of managing its liquidity is to always
                              be
                              able to cope with any prolonged, high-intensity liquidity crises.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB Group is part of the Crédit Agricole Group's scope when
                              it
                              comes to liquidity risk management and uses a system for measuring and containing
                              its liquidity risk that involves maintaining liquidity reserves, organising its funding
                              activities (limitations on short-term funding, staggered scheduling of long-term funding,
                              diversifying sources of funding) and balanced growth in the assets and liabilities
                              sides of its balance sheet. A set of limits, indicators and procedures aims to ensure
                              that this system works correctly.
                              </p>
<p>This internal approach incorporates Crédit Agricole CIB's mandatory compliance
                              with
                              the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; RISK MANAGEMENT</h4>
<p>Within Crédit Agricole CIB, the responsibility for liquidity risk management is
                              spread
                              across a number of departments, including: Finance/Asset and Liability Management
                              (ALM) which is responsible for medium-and long-term (MLT) refinancing management;
                              Treasury Department which is responsible for the operational management of short-term
                              liquidity refinancing and which reports to ALM; and the Risk Department which is in
                              charge of validating the system and ensuring all rules and limits are observed.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DECISIONAL STEERING</h4>
<p>The ALM Committee at the Crédit Agricole CIB Group sets and tracks its Assets and
                              Liabilities Management policy. Together with the Management Committee, it makes up
                              the executive governance body and sets all the operational limits for Crédit Agricole
                              CIB. It is a decision-making body for all major issues especially tracking the raising
                              of MLT funds and monitoring short and long-term limits.
                              </p>
<p>If any tensions arise on the funding markets, joint monitoring committees may be
                              set
                              up involving the General Management, the Risk Department, the Finance Department and
                              the Treasury in order to monitor the Group's liquidity status as closely as possible.
                              Such committees have in fact been meeting regularly since July 2011, given the adverse
                              market conditions and the liquidity constraints imposed on Crédit Agricole CIB.

<p>In addition to traditional sources of short-term liquidity, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              seeks
                              to diversify its funding sources proactively, notably through a structured issues
                              programme specific to the US market, a domestic commercial paper programme in Japan
                              and a CDS programme based in London and intended for sale in Asia.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's long-term liquidity is sourced primarily from interbank loans
                              and various debt security issues (certificates of deposit, BMTNs and EMTNs).
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB makes regular use of its Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programmes.
                              At 31 December 2016, the total amounts issued through EMTN programmes represented
                              approximately €18 billion under UK law and €4 billion under French law.

                              that is paid and/or the amount that is reimbursed upon maturity includes a component
                              that is linked to one or more market indices (equity, interest rate, exchange rate
                              or commodity). Likewise, some issues are known as credit-linked notes i.e. the reimbursement
                              is reduced in the event of default of a third party defined contractually at the time
                              of the issue.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also still holds two Covered Bonds issued by Crédit Agricole

<p>In 2016, Crédit Agricole CIB continued to strengthen its balance sheet by increasing
                              the volume of stable funding through deliberate efforts to increase customer deposits.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; METHODS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's liquidity management and control system is structured around
                              a number of risk indicators:

<p>The definition of these indicators and the way they are to be tracked is established
                              in a set of rules which have been examined and validated by Crédit Agricole CIB and
                              the Crédit Agricole Group.
                              </p>
<p>Operationally, Crédit Agricole's liquidity management and control system is based
                              on an internal tool which produces the indicators set out by the relevant standards.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, regulatory liquidity ratio measurements have been used to help track
                              risk (measurement, forecasts, management). The purpose of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio
                              set out by the European Commission's delegated act is to ensure that the banks have
                              access to a reserve of High-Quality Liquid Assets to cover cash outflow in the event
                              of a 30-day liquidity crisis. The Bank monthly calculates its Liquidity Coverage Ratio
                              on a consolidated basis and declares it to the French Regulatory and resolution supervisory
                              authority (ACPR). The calculation procedures for the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
                              are described in a publication by the Basel Committee dated October 2014. The ratio
                              compares the stock of liabilities with an effective or potential maturity of one year
                              to assets with similar effective or potential maturity. It has been the subject of
                              preliminary analyses and simulations.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; PERMANENT
                              CONTROL SYSTEM</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's standard permanent control procedure is similar to that of
                              the
                              Group. The minimum control indicators are the same and apply to all major processes
                              in the same way. In 2016, the liquidity risk monitoring system relied in particular
                              on a number of tests carried out at various levels involving existing key processes.

                              RATE RISK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK HEDGES</h4>
<p>Within the framework of managing its financial risks, Crédit Agricole CIB uses
                              instruments
                              (interest-rate swaps and forex transactions) for which a hedging relation is established
                              based on the management intention that is followed. The Note 3.4 to the Group consolidated
                              financial statements presents the market values and notional amounts of derivative
                              financial instruments held for hedging.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; FAIR VALUE
                              HEDGES</h4>
<p>The aim is to protect the intrinsic value of fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities
                              that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, by hedging them with instruments
                              that are also at fixed rate. When hedging takes place through derivatives (swaps),
                              the derivatives are termed fair value hedge derivatives.
                              </p>
<p>Hedging carried out in this respect by Asset and Liability Management relates to
                              non-interest-bearing
                              Wealth Management customer deposits, which are analysed as fixed-rate financial liabilities.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; CASH FLOW
                              HEDGES</h4>
<p>The second aim is to protect interest margin so that interest flows generated by
                              variable-rate

                              UNDER IFRS OF FAIR VALUE AND CASH FLOWS HEDGES</h4>
<p>As regards macro-hedges managed by Asset and Liability Management, hedge relationships
                              are documented from inception and checked quarterly through forward and backward looking
                              tests.
                              </p>
<p>For this purpose, hedged items are classified by maturity, using the characteristics
                              of contracts or, for items without contractual maturities (such as demand deposits),
                              runoff models based on each product's behaviour. The comparison between this maturity
                              schedule and that of the derivative instrument allows the efficiency of the hedging
                              to be assessed.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; NET INVESTMENT
                              HEDGES</h4>
<p>The instruments used to manage structural exchange-rate risk are classified as
                              hedges
                              of net investments in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of these hedges is quarterly
                              documented.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2.6 OPERATIONAL
                              RISKS</h4>
<p>Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from shortcomings in internal procedures
                              or information systems, human error or external events that are not linked to a credit,
                              market or liquidity risk.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ 2.6.1 MANAGEMENT
                              OF OPERATIONAL RISKS</h4>
<p>The Risk and Permanent Control Department is responsible for supervising the system,
                              and it is overseen by the Management Board through the operational risk section of
                              Crédit Agricole CIB's Internal Control Committee. This system is described in the
                              Report by the Chairman of the Board of Directors to the General Meeting of Shareholders
                              from page 56.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; GOVERNANCE</h4>
<p>Operational risk management specifically relies on a network of permanent controllers,
                              who also perform the functions of operational risk managers, covering all Group subsidiaries
                              and business lines, and who are supervised by the Risk Management and Permanent Controls
                              division.
                              </p>
<p>The system is monitored by Internal control committees under the authority of each
                              entity's management. Head office Control functions are invited to the meetings of
                              these committees.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; RISK IDENTIFICATION
                              AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS</h4>
<p>In accordance with principles in force within the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB's Risk and Permanent Control Department implemented a qualitative and
                              quantitative system designed to identify, assess, prevent and monitor operational
                              risk, as required by the Basel II reform.
                              </p>
<p>The operational risk mapping process is applied to all Group entities. These risk
                              maps allow Crédit Agricole CIB to supervise the most sensitive processes and to draw
                              up control plans. They are annually updated.
                              </p>

<p>A unified procedure for loss detection and for reporting significant incidents
                              has
                              been set up across the whole scope of Crédit Agricole CIB. The data required by the
                              internal model for calculating the economic capital allocation, in accordance with
                              the Basel II advanced method, are consolidated into a single database that provides
                              historical data for a rolling six-year period.

                              AND ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL</h4>
<p>Capital requirements are calculated annually at the Crédit Agricole CIB level,
                              based
                              on historical loss data together with risk scenarios.
                              </p>
<p>Capital requirement is calculated using the internal AMA methodology (Advanced
                              Measurement
                              Approach) of Crédit Agricole Group applied on Crédit Agricole CIB's scope. This model
                              has been validated at the end of 2007 by the French Regulatory and resolution supervisory
                              authority (ACPR).

<p>The Risk Management and Permanent Controls Department produces a quarterly operational
                              risk scorecard, highlighting key events and movements in costs related to these risks.
                              These scorecards provide global confirmation of the main sources of risks: litigation

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; INSURANCE
                              AND RISK COVERAGE</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has broad insurance coverage of its insurable operating risks
                              in accordance with guidelines set by its parent company, Crédit Agricole S.A., with
                              the aim of protecting its balance sheet and its income statement.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is covered by all Group policies taken out by Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. from major high-risk insurers including for risks which include fraud, all-risk
                              securities (or theft), operating loss, professional civil liability, operational liability,
                              Executive and non-Executive Corporate Officers' civil liability and property damage
                              (buildings and IT, third-party claims for risky buildings).
                              </p>
<p>In addition, Crédit Agricole CIB, like all the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group's business-line
                              subsidiaries, manages smaller risks itself. High-frequency and low-intensity risks
                              that cannot be insured on satisfactory financial terms are retained in the form of
                              deductibles or are pooled within the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group by one of the Crédit
                              Agricole Group's insurance companies.
                              </p>
<p>This general framework may vary according to local regulations and the specific
                              requirements
                              of countries in which the Crédit Agricole CIB Group operates. It is generally complemented
                              by local insurance.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2.7 LEGAL RISKS</h4>
<p>The main legal and tax proceedings outstanding for Crédit Agricole CIB and its
                              fully-consolidated
                              subsidiaries are described in the section on "Legal risks" in the chapter on "Risk
                              factors and Pillar 3" of the 2015 Registration Document. The cases presented below
                              are those that have evolved since 17 March 2016, the date on which Registration Document
                              No D. 16-0159 was filed with the AMF.
                              </p>
<p>Any legal risks outstanding at 31 December 2016 that could have a negative impact
                              on the Group's net assets have been covered by provisions corresponding to the best
                              estimation by the Executive Management on the basis of the information it had.
                              </p>
<p>To date, to the best of Crédit Agricole CIB's knowledge, there is no other governmental,
                              judiciary or arbitration proceeding (or any proceeding known by the Company, in abeyance
                              or that threatens it) that could have or has had, in the previous 12 months, any substantial
                              effect on the financial situation or the profitability of the Company and/or the Group.

<p>In October 2015, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole
                              CIB)
                              and its parent company Crédit Agricole S.A. reached agreements with the US and New
                              York authorities that had been conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions
                              with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement
                              took place between 2003 and 2008.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and Crédit Agricole S.A., which cooperated with the US and

                              York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total
                              penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e. €692.7 million). The payment of this penalty
                              has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore,
                              has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.
                              </p>
<p>The agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal
                              Reserve) and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with
                              CASA and Crédit Agricole CIB. The agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control
                              (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Crédit Agricole CIB. Crédit Agricole
                              CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United
                              States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney
                              of the County of New York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. The USAO and
                              DANY have agreed to take no further action against Crédit Agricole CIB, CASA, or any
                              of Crédit Agricole CIB's subsidiaries or affiliates regarding the conduct subject
                              to this investigation if Crédit Agricole CIB complies with its obligations under the
                              DPAs.
                              </p>
<p>Within the framework of the implementation of these agreements, Crédit Agricole
                              continues
                              to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programs regarding laws on
                              international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York
                              authorities regarding this matter, with its home regulators, the European Central
                              Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with
                              the other regulators across its worldwide network.

<p>Pursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Crédit Agricole's
                              compliance program will be subject to regular reviews to evaluate its effectiveness,
                              including a review by an independent consultant who will be appointed by NYDFS for
                              a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent consultant approved by the

<p>As part of its cooperation with the authorities, Crédit Agricole CIB and its parent
                              company Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out investigations in order to gather the information
                              requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities -
                              the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with
                              which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of

                              related to the Euribor.

<p>In a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly fined Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB €114.654 million for participating in a cartel
                              in euro interest rate derivatives. Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are
                              challenging this decision and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn
                              it.
                              </p>
<p>Additionally, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, is conducting an investigation
                              into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB along with several Swiss and international
                              banks. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition authority (KFTC) decided
                              to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Crédit Agricole CIB and
                              the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and Tibor indices. The KFTC investigation
                              into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) is ongoing.

<p>The two class actions in the United States of America in which Crédit Agricole

                              and Crédit Agricole CIB have been named, since 2012 and 2013, along with other financial
                              institutions - both are defendants in one ("Sullivan" for the Euribor) and only Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ("Lieberman" for the Libor) are still at
                              the preliminary stage of consideration of admissibility.
                              </p>
<p>"Lieberman" class action is currently suspended for procedural reasons in front
                              of
                              the US District Court of New York State. For the "Sullivan" class action, Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to dismiss.

<p>Since 1 July 2016, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB, together with
                              other
                              banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ("Frontpoint")
                              relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer
                              Rate) indices. Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to
                              dismiss. These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim that
                              they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor, SIBOR and SOR rates,
                              and seek repayment of the sums they allege were unlawfully received, as well as damages
                              and reimbursement of costs and fees paid.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; AWSA II</h4>
<p>On 5 June 2015, action was brought against Crédit Agricole CIB in the Nanterre
                              commercial
                              court by Polish companies Autostrada Wielkopolska II SA (AWSA II) and Autostrada Wielkopolska
                              SA (AWSA). On 30 August 2008, AWSA and the Polish Infrastructure Minister signed an
                              Agreement for the Construction and Operation of section 2 of the A2 motorway in Poland.
                              AWSA II, to which AWSA assigned the rights to this concession until March 2037, claims
                              to have suffered financial loss caused by Crédit Agricole CIB due to way in which
                              the transaction financing was structured and is claiming 702.840 million zlotys (PLN)
                              in damages, the equivalent of about €168.579 million. At the 19 October 2016 hearing,
                              the Nanterre Commercial Court ordered a stay of proceedings pending the final decision
                              of the Polish courts in the case between AWSA II and the company that audited the
                              financial model.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; BONDS SSA</h4>
<p>Several regulators have demanded information to Crédit Agricole CIB for inquiries
                              relative to activities of different banks involved on Bonds SSA market (Supranational,
                              Sub-Sovereign and Agencies). Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are included
                              with other banks in various consolidated class actions before the United States District
                              Court for the Southern District of New York. Through the cooperation with these regulators,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB has been proceeding to intern inquiries to gather the required
                              information. This work will continue in 2017. It is not possible at this stage to
                              predict the outcome of these investigations or class actions or the date on which

                              3 DISCLOSURES</h4>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013 requires supervised financial institutions
                              (mainly credit institutions and investment firms) to disclose quantitative and qualitative
                              information on their risk management activities. The risk management system and exposure
                              levels of the Crédit Agricole CIB Group are presented in this section as well as in
                              the "Risk Factors" section.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole CIB Group has chosen to disclose information concerning Pillar
                              3 in a section separate from the section dealing with Risk factors, in order to isolate
                              the items that correspond to the regulatory requirements in terms of publication.
                              The principal purpose of managing the Group's solvency is to assess its share capital
                              and at all times ensure that the Group has sufficient capital to cover the risks to
                              which it is or might be exposed in view of its business activities.
                              </p>
<p>To achieve this objective, the Group uses the Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment
                              Process (ICAAP), which includes i) measurements of regulatory capital requirements
                              and economic capital and ii) the management of these requirements.
                              </p>
<p>ICAAP is conducted according to an interpretation of the principal regulatory requirements
                              listed below (Basel agreements, European Banking Authority guidelines, European Central
                              Bank prudential rules). These include:

<p>Credit institutions and certain investment activities authorised to provide investment
                              services and activities mentioned in Appendix 1 of Directive 2004/39/EC are subject
                              to solvency and large exposure ratios on an individual and, where applicable, sub-group
                              basis, although they may be exempt under the provisions of Article 7 of Regulation
                              (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (CRR).
                              </p>
<p>The French Prudential Supervisory and Resolution Authority (ACPR) has agreed that
                              certain Crédit Agricole Group subsidiaries qualify for this exemption on an individual
                              or, where applicable, sub-group basis. In that regard, the ACPR provided Crédit Agricole
                              CIB with an exemption on an individual basis.
                              </p>
<p>The transition to CRR/CRD IV does not challenge the individual exemptions granted
                              by the ACPR prior to 1 January 2014, based on the pre-existing regulatory provisions.

                              ad hoc entities that are equity-accounted for regulatory purposes. In addition, entities
                              consolidated for accounting purposes using the proportional method at 31 December
                              2013 and now consolidated under the equity method for accounting purposes, in accordance
                              with IFRS 11, continue to be consolidated proportionally for regulatory purposes.
                              Information on these entities as well as their consolidation method for accounting
                              purposes is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at 31

<p>Capital, calculated on a fully loaded Basel III<sup>(1)</sup> basis, takes into
                              account the following changes compared with 31 December 2013 under
                              Basel 2.5:
                              </p>
<p>1. Elimination of most prudential filters, in particular as regards unrealised
                              capital
                              gains and losses on equity instruments and available-for-sale debt securities. As
                              an exception, capital gains and losses from cash flow hedges and due to changes in
                              the credit quality of the institution (liabilities measured at fair value) remain
                              filtered. Moreover, a filter is introduced in connection with the DVA (change in valuation
                              due to the credit quality of the institution on derivative instruments recognised
                              as liabilities);
                              </p>
<p>2. Partial derecognition of minority interests and other equity instruments issued
                              by eligible subsidiaries<sup>(2)</sup> in excess of the amount of capital required
                              to cover the subsidiary's capital requirements.
                              This partial derecognition applies to each capital component. Meanwhile, ineligible
                              minority interests are excluded;
                              </p>
<p>3. Deduction from the CET1 of Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) that rely on future profitability
                              arising from tax loss carryforwards;
                              </p>
<p>4. Deduction from the CET1 of negative amounts resulting from any shortfall of
                              provisions
                              relative to Expected Losses (EL), calculated with a distinction between performing
                              and non-performing loans;
                              </p>
<p>5. Deduction from CET1 of Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) that rely on future profitability
                              arising from temporary differences above an exemption threshold of 17.65% of CET1.
                              This exemption, applied after calculating a 10% threshold, is aggregated with the
                              non-deducted portion of CET1 instruments held in financial stakes Items not deducted
                              are included in risk-weighted assets (250% weighting);
                              </p>
<p>6. Deduction from CET1 of the CET1 instruments held in financial stakes greater
                              than
                              10% (significant investments) beyond an exemption threshold of 17.65% of CET1, with
                              treatment identical to that described in the previous point. The deduction relates
                              to directly held stakes greater than 10% and indirect investments (in particular via
                              UCITS). These latter investments are now counted for deduction purposes. Their total
                              amount is aggregated with above mentioned direct financial investments where they
                              are identified as financial investments. In general, the equity component, and in
                              some cases the entire UCITS portfolio is deducted from CET1 without applying the exemption.
                              Investments in insurance businesses are deducted from CET1 (integrated into other
                              deductions covered by an exemption mechanism);
                              </p>
<p>7. Restriction of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to hybrid debt instruments satisfying
                              the inclusion criteria for Basel III eligibility;
                              </p>
<p>8. Value adjustments arising from the prudent valuation laid down in the regulatory
                              framework: institutions must apply the prudent valuation principle and adjust the
                              amount of their assets measured at fair value and deduct any value adjustment.
                              </p>
<p>Some of these items are also being phased in, as described below in point 3.1.4.</p>

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ 3.1.4 TRANSITIONAL
                              IMPLEMENTATION PHASE</h4>
<p>To make it easier for credit institutions to comply with CRR/CRD IV, certain requirements
                              were relaxed on a transitional basis, notably the gradual introduction of new capital
                              component:
                              </p>
<p>1. Transitional application of the treatment of prudential filters on unrealised
                              gains
                              and losses on available-for-sale financial assets (as of 31 December 2016, the provisions
                              of ECB Regulation 2016/445 replaces the national provisions indicated by the ACPR
                              in its communication of 12 December 2013): progressive integration into CET1 of unrealised
                              capital gains and losses on sovereign debt issues (40% in 2015; 60% in 2016; 80% in
                              2017 and 100% in subsequent years). Conversely, unrealised capital losses on other
                              issuers have been included from 2014;
                              </p>
<p>2. Progressive deduction of the partial derecognition or exclusion of minority
                              interests
                              by tranche rising by 20% per annum with effect from 1 January 2015; the CRD III method
                              is still applied to the remaining amount (40% in 2016);
                              </p>
<p>3. Progressive deduction of Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) that rely on future profitability
                              arising from tax loss carryforwards by tranche rising by 20% per annum with effect
                              from 1 January 2014. The residual amount (40% in 2016) remains subject to the CRD
                              III treatment method (0% risk weighting);
                              </p>
<p>4. No transitional application of the deduction of negative amounts arising from
                              insufficient
                              provisions relative to the expected loss (it should be noted that under CRD III the
                              deduction was 50% of Tier 1 and 50% of Tier 2 capital), with the amounts calculated
                              now distinguishing between performing loans and receivables and those in default;
                              </p>
<p>5. Progressive deduction from the CET1 of deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from
                              temporary differences: the amount that exceeds the dual exemption threshold that is
                              partially aggregated with financial stakes greater than 10% is deducted by tranche
                              rising by 20% per annum with effect from 1 January 2014. The items covered by the
                              exemption thresholds are weighted 250%. The residual amount exceeding the exemption
                              (40% in 2016) remains subject to the CRD III method (0% risk weighting);
                              </p>
<p>6. Gradual deduction of CET1 instruments held in significant financial stakes (over
                              10%): the residual amount by which the double exemption threshold common to the deferred
                              tax assets referred to in the previous point is exceeded is deducted according to
                              the same approaches described above. The items covered by the exemption are also risk-weighted
                              at 250%. The residual amount exceeding the exemption (40% in 2016) remains subject
                              to the CRD III method (deduction of 50% of Tier 1 and 50% of Tier 2 capital);
                              </p>
<p>7. The hybrid debt instruments that were eligible to capital under Basel II and
                              which
                              are no longer eligible as capital owing to the entry into force of the new regulation
                              can, under certain conditions, be eligible to the grandfathering clause. Under this
                              clause, these instruments are gradually excluded over an eight-year period, with a
                              10% reduction each year. In 2016, 60% of the declared global inventories at 31 December
                              2012 is recognised, and then 50% in 2017, etc. The derecognised portion may be recognised
                              in the lowest tier of capital (from AT1 to Tier 2, for example) if it satisfies the
                              corresponding criteria.
                              </p>
<p>Lastly, intangible assets (including goodwill) are 100%-deducted from CET1, in
                              accordance
                              with the national transposition of transitional application rules.

<p>These buffers come into force on an incremental basis from 1 January 2016 to 2019
                              (25% of the required buffer in 2016, 50% in 2017, etc.). The buffer for systemic risk
                              can be implemented by a national authority if it provides documentary evidence to
                              the European Banking Authority. When the countercyclical buffer rate is changed at
                              the country level in a country where the company does business, the application date
                              must be at least 12 months after the date the change was published. In 2016, only
                              Norway and Sweden have defined a contracyclical buffer. The increments above apply
                              at the end of the 12-month advance notice period. These buffers must be covered by
                              CET1.

<p>The phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital stood at €14.4 billion at 31

                              2016, or €0.4 billion higher than the fully loaded amount. This variance resulted
                              mainly from the phasing of the excess over and above the ceiling (+€0.4 billion).
                              The unfavourable phasing on unrealised capital gains and losses (-€0.1 billion) was
                              offset by the exclusion of minority interests, deferred tax assets and DVA (+€0.1
                              billion).

                              RATIO</h4>
<p>Article 429 of the CRR specifying the methods for calculating the leverage ratio
                              was
                              amended and replaced by the Delegated Act No 2015/62 of 10 October 2014. The delegated
                              act was published in the OJEU on 18 January 2015.
                              </p>
<p>Publication of the ratio at least once a year is mandatory as of 1 January 2015.
                              Institutions
                              can choose to publish a fully loaded ratio, a phased-in ratio or both ratios.
                              </p>
<p>If the institution decides to change its publication choice, at the time of first
                              publication it must reconcile the data for all of the ratios previously published
                              with the data for the new ratios selected for publication.
                              </p>
<p>An observation period has been introduced for the leverage ratio running from 1
                              January
                              2014 to 1 January 2017 to monitor the components and the behaviour of the ratio relative
                              to the requirements based on risk.
                              </p>
<p>According to the draft texts published on 23 November 2016 for CRR II/CRD V legislation,
                              the implementation in Pillar 1, which was initially scheduled in CRR for 1 January
                              2018, could be delayed.
                              </p>
<p>A requirement for a two-level leverage ratio is envisaged: it could be 3%, the
                              level
                              indicated by the Basel Committee for non G-SIB, and a higher level for the G-SIB.
                              The leverage ratio is defined as the Tier 1 capital divided by the exposure measure,
                              i.e. balance sheet and off-balance-sheet assets after certain restatements of derivatives,

                              SFT: Securities Financing Transaction.<br/>
</a>
</p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB considers the leverage ratio as an additional measure to the
                              constraints
                              that weigh on solvency and liquidity, and that already limit the size of the balance
                              sheet. As part of the process of monitoring excess leverage, constraints are actively
                              managed. Crédit Agricole CIB's leverage ratio increased by 0.41 bps in 2016.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ 3.2.3 MREL/TLAC
                              RATIO</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; MREL RATIO</h4>
<p>The MREL (or Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities) ratio,
                              is
                              defined in the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) published on
                              12 June 2014 and effective starting 1 January 2015 (except for provisions on bail-in
                              and MREL, which became applicable in 2016).
                              </p>
<p>More generally, the BRRD establishes a framework for the resolution of banks throughout
                              the European Union and with the aim of equipping resolution authorities with shared
                              instruments and powers to pre-emptively tackle banking crises, preserve financial
                              stability and reduce taxpayers' exposure to losses.
                              </p>
<p>The MREL ratio corresponds to the minimum requirement of own funds and eligible
                              liabilities
                              in order to absorb losses in the event of resolution. This minimum requirement is
                              calculated as being the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities expressed as
                              a percentage of the institution's total liabilities and capital. In this calculation,
                              total liabilities takes into account the full recognition of offsetting rights applicable
                              to derivatives. Regulatory capital, subordinated notes with a residual maturity of
                              more than one year (including prudentially ineligible own fund instruments and the
                              amortised portion of Tier 2) and non-preferred senior debts with residual maturities
                              of more than one year qualify for inclusion in MREL. MREL eligible preferred senior
                              debt is subject to the appreciation of the Single Resolution Board (SRB).
                              </p>
<p>The MREL ratio calibrates an eligible liabilities requirement but does not specify
                              which debt would be called upon to absorb losses in the event of resolution.
                              </p>
<p>Since September 2015, Crédit Agricole Group has already reached a MREL ratio of
                              8%
                              excluding preferred senior debt, which, in the event of resolution, would enable recourse
                              to the European resolution fund before applying the bail-in to preferred senior debt,
                              creating an additional layer of protection for preferred senior investors. Crédit
                              Agricole CIB will be subject to a MREL objective to be set by the resolution authorities
                              that might be different to the 8% target chosen by the Group. In 2016, the SRB only
                              gave the Group a guideline for the MREL target that was not binding at the consolidated
                              level. By the end of 2017, the SRB could set a MREL requirement for the Group at the
                              consolidated level and take its first MREL decisions at the individual level. In view
                              of the European Commission's legislative proposal of amendments to the BRRD published
                              on 23 November 2016, the denominator of the MREL may in the long term converge towards
                              that of the TLAC ratio (see hereafter), and become a Pillar 2 requirement effective
                              in 2019 at the earliest.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; TLAC RATIO</h4>
<p>This ratio, whose modalities were indicated in a Term Sheet published on 9 November
                              2015, was established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) at the request of the
                              G20. The FSB defined the calculation of a ratio aimed at estimating the adequacy of
                              the bail-in and recapitalisation capacities of Global Systemically Important banks
                              (G-SIB). This new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratio, which will be transposed
                              at the European level into the CRR and come into effect from 2019, will provide the
                              resolution authorities with a means to assess whether G-SIBs have sufficient bail-in
                              capacity before and during resolution. As a result, the resolution authorities will
                              be able to implement an ordered resolution strategy that minimises impacts on financial
                              stability, ensures the continuity of the G-SIBs' critical economic functions and limits
                              the use of taxpayers' money.
                              </p>
<p>According to the provisions of the TLAC Term Sheet included in the European Commission's
                              legislative proposal of amendments to the CRR published on 23 November 2016, the minimum
                              level of the TLAC ratio corresponds to twice the minimum regulatory requirements (i.e.
                              the maximum between 6% of the leverage ratio denominator and 16% of the risk-weighted
                              assets, plus applicable regulatory buffers) effective 1 January 2019, and the maximum
                              between 6.75% of the leverage ratio denominator and 18% of the risk-weighted assets
                              (excluding buffers) from 1 January 2022. This minimum level could be increased by
                              the resolution authorities through the MREL requirement (see previous point).
                              </p>
<p>The elements that could absorb losses are made up of equity, subordinated notes
                              and
                              debts to which the resolution authority can apply the bail-in.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole Group must comply with a TLAC ratio over 19.5% (including a capital
                              conservation buffer of 2.5% and a G-SIB buffer of 1%) from 2019 then 21.5% from 2022.
                              Crédit Agricole Group aims to comply with these TLAC requirements excluding eligible
                              preferred senior debt, subject to changes in methods of calculating risk-weighted
                              assets. At 31 December 2016, the TLAC to risk-weighted assets ratio is estimated at
                              20.3%<sup>(1)</sup> for Crédit Agricole Group, excluding eligible preferred senior
                              debt.
                              </p>
<p>This ratio will apply solely to Global Systemically Important Institutions, and
                              thus
                              to Crédit Agricole Group, starting in 2019.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB will not be subject to this ratio, as it is not classified
                              as
                              a G-SIB by the FSB.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ 3.2.4 ENCUMBERED
                              ASSETS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB monitors and manages the level of its assets pledged as collateral.
                              At 31 December 2016, the ratio of encumbered assets to total assets was 16.23%.
                              </p>
<p>On loans and receivables due from private customers, assets are pledged to obtain
                              refinancing under advantageous conditions or to constitute reserves that can easily
                              be made liquid if needed. Crédit Agricole CIB's policy seeks to diversify its refinancing
                              in order to better withstand liquidity stresses that may affect given markets differently
                              and to limit the number of assets pledged as collateral in order to conserve high-quality
                              unencumbered assets that can be easily liquidated through existing channels in the
                              event of stress.
                              </p>
<p>The other sources of collateral are mainly pledged securities as well as cash (mainly
                              on margin calls):

<p>Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital eligible under Basel III consists of perpetual
                              debt
                              instruments without any redemption incentive or obligation (in particular step-up

                              </p>
<p>AT1 instruments must be subject to a loss absorption mechanism triggered when the
                              CET1 ratio falls below a threshold of at least 5.125%. The instruments may be converted
                              into shares or written down. Payments must be totally flexible: no automatic remuneration
                              mechanisms allowed, suspension of coupon payments at the issuer's discretion permitted.
                              </p>
<p>Equity instruments in financial sector entities related to this compartment (AT1)
                              are deducted along with those resulting from transitional application rules.

                              the impact of the cap resulting from the grandfathering provision.
                              </p>
<p>The Basel III eligible issue has two loss absorption mechanisms that are triggered
                              when Crédit Agricole CIB Group's phased-in CET1 ratio drops below 5.125%.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB Group's phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.66% at 31 December 2016.
                              They
                              accordingly represent a capital buffer of €8.1 billion relative to the loss absorption

<p>With respect to liquidity risk, the Group ensures the quality of the systems used
                              to manage and supervise this risk, as well as the appropriateness of its liquidity
                              continuity plan. Therefore, as at 31 December 2016, the following Pillar 2 risks have
                              been taken into account: interest rate risk on the banking portfolio, the effect of
                              geo-sectorial diversification and country/sovereign risk. In addition to these risks,
                              the measurement of economic capital includes the requirement to check that the capital
                              requirements calculated for the purposes of Pillar 1 adequately cover the risks related
                              to securitisation transactions.
                              </p>
<p>Economic capital for credit risk exposures is based on an internal economic capital
                              model enabling a more thorough understanding of concentrations in credit portfolios.
                              For market risk, which is monitored through VaR, economic capital fully integrates
                              the regulatory changes that came into effect under Pillar 1 (stressed VaR, IRC). The
                              horizon of capital measurement is made consistent with that used for other risks.
                              </p>
<p>For interest rate risk on the banking portfolio, the Crédit Agricole CIB Group,
                              when
                              calculating economic capital, applies interest rate and inflation shocks. In respect
                              of the interest rate shocks applied, impacts on all directional, optional and behavioural
                              risks are measured for each of the significant currencies. The calculation of economic
                              capital also includes the offsetting impact provided by the lesser of (i) annual net
                              interest margin and (ii) annual gross operating income, capped at 20% of total capital.
                              The measurement of economic capital is supplemented by a latest estimate for the current
                              year, consistent with forecast capital requirements at the same date, in such a way
                              as to take into account the effects of the principal regulatory reforms that can be
                              foreseen.
                              </p>
<p>In addition to the quantitative aspect, the Group's approach also relies on a qualitative
                              component supplementing the measurement of economic capital requirements with indicators
                              of the business lines' exposure to risk and their permanent controls. The qualitative
                              component meets three objectives:

<p>A general overview of credit and counterparty risk is presented in Part 3.5.1,
                              followed
                              by a more detailed examination of credit risk (Part 3.5.2) by type of regulatory method:
                              standard method (page 230) and IRBA method (page 233). Counterparty risk is examined
                              in Part 3.5.3, followed by a section devoted to risk reduction techniques for credit
                              and counterparty risk (Part 3.5.4).

                              BY TYPE OF RISK</h4>
<p>The following tables hereafter show the Crédit Agricole CIB Group's exposure to
                              credit
                              risk by exposure category for the standard and internal ratings-based approaches.
                              This exposure corresponds to gross exposure (on and off-balance sheet) after netting
                              and before risk mitigation techniques (guarantees and collateral).
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB calculates counterparty risk for all its exposures, whether
                              in
                              the banking book or the trading book. For items in the trading book, counterparty
                              risk is calculated in accordance with the provisions relating to the prudential supervision
                              of market risk.
                              </p>
<p>The regulatory treatment of counterparty risk on forward financial instruments
                              in
                              the banking book is defined for regulatory purposes in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013
                              of 26 June 2013. Crédit Agricole CIB uses the internal model method (Article 283)
                              to measure its exposure to counterparty risk on forward financial instruments.
                              </p>
<p>Securities exposed to counterparty risk were valued at €66.6 billion at 31 December
                              2016 (including €10.5 billion of repos and €56.04 billion of forward financial instruments).

<p>Since the end of 2007, the ACPR has authorised Crédit Agricole CIB Group to use
                              internal
                              rating systems to calculate regulatory capital requirements as regards credit risk
                              for most of its scope. In addition, the ACPR has since 1 January 2008 authorised Crédit
                              Agricole CIB Group's main entities to use the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)
                              to calculate their regulatory capital requirements for operational risk. The Group's
                              other entities use the standardised approach, in accordance with regulations.

<p>The main Crédit Agricole CIB Group subsidiaries or portfolios still using the standardised

<p>CA Indosuez Wealth Management is subject to standard calculation methodology in
                              respect
                              of its operational risk only. In accordance with the commitment made by the Group
                              to gradually move toward the advanced method defined with the ACPR in May 2007 (roll-out
                              plan), work is ongoing in the main entities and portfolios still under the standard
                              method. An update of the rollout plan is sent annually to the competent authority.
                              </p>
<p>The use of internal models to calculate the solvency ratios has enabled Crédit
                              Agricole
                              CIB Group to strengthen its risk management. Specifically, the development of "internal
                              ratings-based" approaches has led to the systematic and reliable collection of default
                              and loss histories for most Group entities. The establishment of this data history
                              makes it possible to quantify credit risk today by assigning an average Probability
                              of Default (PD) to each rating level, and for the "advanced internal rating" approaches
                              to assign a loss given default (LGD).
                              </p>
<p>In addition, the parameters of the "Internal Ratings-Based" models are used in
                              the
                              definition, implementation and monitoring of the entities' risk and credit policies.
                              The internal risk assessment models thus promote the development of sound risk management
                              practices by the Group's entities and improve the efficiency of the capital allocation
                              process by enabling a more fine-tuned measurement of capital consumption by each business
                              line and entity.

                              RISKS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB, like its parent, addresses counterparty risks for all of its
                              exposures, whether these depend on the banking portfolio or the trading book (portfolio).
                              For items in the trading book, counterparty risk is calculated in accordance with
                              the provisions relating to the regulatory supervision of market risk.
                              </p>
<p>The regulatory treatment of counterparty risk on transactions on forward financial
                              instruments in the banking portfolio is defined on a regulatory basis in Regulation
                              (EU) 575/2013 of 26 June 2013. Crédit Agricole S.A. Group uses the market price method
                              to measure its exposure to counterparty risk on transactions on forward financial
                              instruments in the banking portfolio (Article 274) or the internal model method (Article
                              283) within the scope of Crédit Agricole CIB.

                              RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT
                              SYSTEM</h4>
<p>The main categories of collateral taken by the Bank are described under "Risk Factors
                              - Credit Risk - Collateral and Guarantees Received", page 173.
                              </p>
<p>When a credit is granted, collateral is analysed specifically to assess the value
                              of the asset, its liquidity, volatility and the correlation between the value of the
                              collateral and the quality of the counterparty financed. Regardless of collateral
                              quality, the first criterion in the lending decision is always the borrower's ability
                              to repay sums due from cash flow generated by its operating activities, except for
                              specific trade finance transactions.
                              </p>
<p>For financial collateral, a minimum exposure coverage ratio is usually included
                              in
                              loan contracts, with readjustment clauses. Financial collateral is revalued according
                              to the frequency of margin calls and the variability of the underlying value of the
                              financial assets transferred as collateral or quarterly, as a minimum.
                              </p>
<p>The minimum coverage ratio (or the haircut applied to the value of the collateral
                              under Basel II) is determined by measuring the pseudo-maximum deviation of the value
                              of the securities on the revaluation date. This measurement is calculated with a 99%
                              confidence interval over a time horizon covering the period between each revaluation,
                              the period between the default date and the date on which asset liquidation starts,
                              and the duration of the liquidation period. This haircut also applies for currency
                              mismatch risk when the securities and the collateralised exposure are denominated
                              in different currencies. Additional haircuts are applied when the size of the stock
                              position necessitates a block sale or when the borrower and the issuer of the collateral
                              securities belong to the same risk group.
                              </p>
<p>Other types of asset may also be pledged as non recourse financial assets. This
                              is
                              notably the case for certain activities such as asset financing for aircrafts, shipping,
                              real estate or commodities.
                              </p>

                              OF SECURITISATION TRANSACTIONS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB Group carries out securitisation transactions as an originator,
                              sponsor or investor in accordance with the Basel III criteria.
                              </p>
<p>The securitisation transactions listed below are transactions as defined in Directive
                              2013/36/EU (CRD IV) and Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of 26 June 2013 (CRR), in force as
                              from 1 January 2014. The directive and regulations incorporate into European law the
                              international Basel III reforms (issued in December 2010) introducing, among other
                              things, new requirements for bank solvency and oversight of liquidity risk. They cover
                              transactions or structures under which the credit risk associated with an exposure
                              or pool of exposures is subdivided into tranches and which have the following features:

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's activities to transfer risk through proprietary securitisation
                              are as follows:
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">ACTIVE MANAGEMENT
                              OF THE FINANCING PORTFOLIO</h4>
<p>In addition to the use of credit derivatives (see "Risk factors and Pillar 3",
                              section
                              Credit risks - Use of credit derivatives), this activity consists of using securitisation
                              to manage the credit risk in the corporate financing portfolio, optimising the allocation
                              of equity, reducing the concentration of outstanding loans to corporates, freeing
                              up resources to contribute to the renewal of the banking portfolio (in the framework
                              of the Distribute to Originate model) and optimising the profitability of shareholders'
                              funds. This activity is managed by the ALM/CPM Execution teams. The supervisory formula
                              approach is used to calculate the weighted exposures on proprietary securitisations.
                              In this activity, the Bank does not systematically purchase insurance on all tranches,
                              as the management goal is to cover some of the most risky financing portfolio tranches
                              whilst keeping part of the overall risk.

                              CARRIED OUT BY CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CIB IN 2016</h4>
<p>As part of the active management of the financing portfolio, the ALM/CPM Execution
                              teams implemented the synthetic securitisation of a portfolio of €1 billion consisting
                              of corporate exposures. A second synthetic securitisation of a $3 billion secured
                              funding portfolio was finalised in February 2017.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DISCONTINUING
                              OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>These consist of investments that are either managed in run-off, or exposures for
                              which the risk is considered to be low and that Crédit Agricole CIB is willing to
                              carry for the long term. In 2009, these were segregated into a dedicated prudential
                              banking book in 2009. These activities generate no market risk.
                              </p>
<p>During 2016, the portfolio underwent a partial reduction following the natural
                              repayment
                              of certain positions.

                              facilities
                              to securitisation vehicles or act as counterparty for derivatives in securitisation
                              transactions involving special purpose vehicles. These transactions typically involve
                              currency swaps granted to ABCP conduits and interest rate swaps for certain ABS issues.
                              These activities are recorded in the banking book as investor activities.
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, Crédit Agricole CIB may be called upon to directly finance on its balance
                              sheet some securitisation transactions on behalf of its customers (mainly aeronautic
                              or vehicle fleet financing transactions) or provide support through a liquidity facility
                              to an issue carried out by special purpose entities not part of the Bank (SPV or ABCP
                              program not sponsored by the Bank). In this case, Crédit Agricole CIB is deemed to
                              be an investor. This activity represented outstandings of €2 billion at 31 December
                              2016 (€2.3 billion at 31 December 2015).

                              the Bank retains a relatively low risk insofar as it sometimes contributes back-up
                              lines to the vehicles that issue the securities or holds a share of the securities
                              issued.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; RISK MONITORING</h4>
<p>Risk management related to securitisation transactions follows the rules established
                              by the Group and depends on whether the assets are recognised in the banking book
                              (credit and counterparty risk) or trading book (market and counterparty risk).
                              </p>
<p>The development, scaling and targeting of securitisation transactions are periodically
                              reviewed by Portfolio Strategy Committees specific to those activities and the respective
                              countries, as well as by the Group Risks Committees. Risks on securitisation transactions
                              are measured against the capacity of the assets transferred to financing vehicles
                              to generate sufficient flows to cover the costs, mainly financial, of these vehicles.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB's securitisation exposures are treated using the IRB-securitisation

<p>These ratings include all the types of risk implied by securitisation transactions:
                              intrinsic risks on loans and receivables (insolvency of the borrower, payment delays,
                              dilution, offsetting of receivables) or risks on the structuring of transactions (legal
                              risks, risks related to the settlement channels for loans and receivables, risks related
                              to the quality of the information periodically supplied by the administrator of transferred
                              loans and receivables, other risks related to the transferor, etc.).
                              </p>
<p>These critically examined ratings are only a tool for making decisions pertaining
                              to these transactions; such decisions are taken by Credit Committees at various levels.
                              Credit decisions impose on the transactions, which are reviewed at least on an annual
                              basis by these same committees, different limits as the acquired portfolio changes
                              (levels for late payments, losses, concentration by sector or geographic area, dilution
                              of loans and receivables or the periodic valuation of assets by independent experts,
                              etc.) the non-respect of which may result in a tightening of the structure or the
                              early amortisation of the transaction.
                              </p>
<p>These credit decisions also include, in liaison with the Bank's other Credit Committees,
                              an assessment focusing on the risk generated by the recipients of the receivables
                              and the possibility of substituting the manager by a new one in the event of mismanagement
                              of those receivables. Like all credit decisions, these decisions include aspects of
                              compliance and "country risk".
                              </p>
<p>The liquidity risk associated with securitisation activities is monitored by the
                              business
                              lines in charge, but also centrally by the Market Risk and Asset and Liability Management
                              (ALM) Departments. The impact of these activities is incorporated into the Internal
                              Liquidity Model indicators - mainly the stress scenarios, liquidity ratios and liquidity
                              gaps. The management of liquidity risk at Crédit Agricole CIB is described in more
                              detail in the paragraph "Liquidity and financing risk" of the Risk Factors part of
                              this section.

<p>The management of structural foreign exchange risk with respect to securitisation
                              activities does not differ from that of the Group's other assets. As regards interest
                              rate risk management, securitised assets are refinanced through special purpose vehicles
                              according to rules for matching interest rates closely to those of the other assets.
                              </p>
<p>For assets of discontinuing activities, each transfer of position is first approved
                              by Crédit Agricole CIB's Market Risk Department.

                              POLICIES</h4>
<p>As part of securitisation transactions, Crédit Agricole CIB carries out a de-recognition
                              test with regard to IAS 39 (the criteria for which are listed in Note 1.3 on accounting
                              policies and principles of the consolidated financial statements).
                              </p>
<p>In the case of synthetic securitisations, the assets are not derecognised, as they
                              remain under the control of the institution. The assets continue to be recognised
                              according to their original classification and valuation method (see Note 1.3 on Accounting
                              policies and principles of the consolidated financial statements for the classification
                              and valuation of financial assets).
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, investments in securitisation instruments (cash or synthetic) are recognised
                              on the basis of their classification and their associated valuation (see Note 1.3
                              on Accounting policies and principles of the consolidated financial statements for
                              the classification and valuation of financial assets). Securitisation positions can
                              be classified into the following accounting categories:

<p>For positions recognised at fair value through profit or loss, gains on disposal
                              are
                              recognised under "Net gains/(losses) on financial instruments at fair value through

                              adopted by the European Union and should come into effect on the same date.
                              </p>
<p>For the first application of this standard, Crédit Agricole CIB Group elected to
                              apply
                              the modified retrospective method, recognising the cumulative effect as of 1 January
                              2018, with no comparison for 2017, with any impact the standard has on the various
                              items in the financial statements being detailed in the notes.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 15 will replace IAS 11 "Construction Contracts" and IAS 18 "Revenue", along
                              with
                              all the related interpretations relating to IFRIC 13 "Customer Loyalty Programs",

<p>IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments. It was
                              adopted
                              by the European Union on 22 November 2016 and published in the Official Journal of
                              the European Union on 29 November 2016. It will be mandatory for fiscal years beginning
                              on or after 1 January 2018.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CLASSIFICATION
                              AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS</h4>
<p>Under IFRS 9, the classification and measurement criteria depend on the nature
                              of
                              the financial asset, namely whether it qualifies as a debt instrument (i.e. loan,
                              advance, credit, bond, fund unit) or an equity instrument (i.e. share).
                              </p>
<p>In the case of debt instruments (loans and fixed or determinable income securities),
                              IFRS 9 tests the business model and contractual terms to classify and measure financial
                              assets.

                              terms ("Solely Payments of Principal" &amp; Interest" or "SPPI" test)</h4>
<p>This second criterion is applied to the contractual terms of the loan or debt security
                              to determine the accounting classification and measurement category to which the instrument
                              belongs.
                              </p>

                              and interest (i.e. simple rate), its contractual terms are deemed too complex and
                              as a result, the loan or debt security is recognised at fair value through profit
                              or loss regardless of their business model. This involves the instruments that do
                              not satisfy the conditions of the "SPPI" test.
                              </p>
<p>Certain issues of interpretation are still being examined by the IASB in this regard.
                              Thus, Crédit Agricole Group pays close attention to IASB discussions with particular
                              regard to additional compensation for early repayment and will, where necessary, take
                              on board the outcome of these discussions. On the basis of the foregoing criteria:

                              summary, the Group's application of the classification and measurement requirements
                              of IFRS 9 should result in an increase in the proportion of financial instruments
                              - UCITS and equity instruments - measured at fair value through profit or loss. Overall,
                              loans and receivables satisfy the "SPPI" test and will remain at amortised cost.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">IMPAIRMENT</h4>
<p>IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model that requires the recognition of Expected
                              Credit Losses (ECL) on credit and debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at
                              fair value through other comprehensive income (items that can be recycled), on loan
                              commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are not recognised at fair value,
                              as well as lease receivables and trade receivables. This new ECL approach is designed
                              to bring forward as much as possible the recognition of expected credit losses whereas
                              under the IAS 39 provisioning model it is subject to there being objective evidence
                              that an impairment loss has been incurred.
                              </p>
<p>ECL is defined as the weighted expected probable value of the discounted credit
                              loss
                              (principal and interest). It represents the present value of the difference between
                              the contractual cash flows and the expected cash flows (including principal and interest).
                              </p>
<p>The formula includes the probability of default, loss given default and exposure
                              at
                              default parameters. These calculations are broadly based on the internal models used
                              as part of the regulatory framework, but with adjustments to determine an economic
                              ECL.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 9 recommends a Point in Time analysis while considering historical loss data
                              and forward looking macro-economic data, whereas the regulatory perspective is analysed
                              Through The Cycle for probability of default and in a downturn for loss given default.
                              </p>
<p>The accounting approach also requires the recalculation of certain Basel parameters,
                              in particular to eliminate internal recovery costs or floors that are imposed by the
                              regulator in the regulatory calculation of Loss Given Default (LGD). The new credit
                              risk provisioning model has three stages:

<p>At the second stage, the monitoring and estimation of the significant deterioration
                              in credit risk can be done on a transaction-by-transaction basis or collectively at
                              portfolio level by grouping financial instruments on the basis of similar credit risk
                              characteristics. The approach calls on a wide range of information, including historical
                              data on observed losses, cyclical and structural adjustments, and loss projections
                              based on reasonable scenarios.
                              </p>
<p>This deterioration depends on the risk level on the date of initial recognition
                              and
                              must be recognised before the transaction is impaired (3rd stage).

                              of the outstanding amounts for which the internal ratings systems have been designed,
                              particularly for exposures monitored by the advanced method, considering that all

<p>With respect to hedge accounting (excluding fair value macro-hedging transactions),

<p>IFRS 9 allows the early adoption of requirements relating to specific credit risk
                              relating to financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss,
                              namely the recognition of changes in value attributable to specific credit risk in
                              other comprehensive income (items that cannot be recycled). At this stage, in accordance
                              with the Group's guidelines, Crédit Agricole CIB has decided against early adoption
                              of these requirements.

                              of the 2017 comparative financial statements. As a result, the Group does not plan
                              to restate the financial statements presented for comparative purposes with the 2018

<p>The standards and interpretations published by the IASB at 31 December 2016, but
                              not
                              yet adopted by the European Union, are not applied by the Group. They will become
                              mandatory only as from the date planned by the European Union and have not been applied
                              by the Group at 31 December 2016.
                              </p>
<p>This concerns IFRS 16 in particular.</p>
<p>IFRS 16 "Leases" will replace IAS 17 and related interpretations (IFRIC 4 "Determining
                              Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease", SIC 15 "Operating Leases - Incentives" and
                              SIC 27 "Evaluating the Substance of Transactions in the Legal Form of a Lease"). It
                              will apply to reporting periods beginning 1 January 2019.
                              </p>
<p>The main change made by IFRS 16 has to do with accounting for lessees. IFRS 16
                              will
                              call for a model in respect of lessees that recognises all leases on the balance sheet,
                              with a lease liability on the liability side representing commitments over the life
                              of the lease and on the asset side, an amortisable right-to-use.
                              </p>
<p>An impact study on the implementation of the standard in the Crédit Agricole Group
                              will be undertaken in 2017 in order to assess the main effects at issue.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, three amendments to existing standards have been published by the
                              IASB
                              that pose no major issue to the Group: these are the amendments to IAS 7 "Statement
                              of Cash flows", to IAS 12 "Income Taxes", which apply to Crédit Agricole S.A. Group
                              as of 1 January 2017, while the amendment to IFRS 2 "Classification and Measurement
                              of Share-based Payment Transactions" will be applicable as of 1 January 2018. These
                              dates will be confirmed once the standards have been adopted by the European Union.

                              INSTRUMENTS (IAS 32 AND 39)</h4>
<p>Financial assets and liabilities are treated in the financial statements in accordance
                              with IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Commission.
                              </p>
<p>At the time of initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities
                              are
                              measured at fair value including trading costs (with the exception of financial instruments
                              recognised at fair value through profit or loss). Subsequently, financial assets and
                              financial liabilities are measured according to their classification, either at fair
                              value or at amortised cost based on the effective interest rate method.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
                              or
                              paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants,
                              on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the measurement date. The effective
                              interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or
                              receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate,
                              a shorter period, to obtain the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial
                              liability.

<p>According to IAS 39, this portfolio comprises securities that are classified under
                              financial assets at fair value through profit or loss either as a result of a genuine
                              intention to trade them (financial assets held for trading) or of being designated
                              at fair value by Crédit Agricole CIB.
                              </p>
<p>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are assets acquired or generated
                              by the enterprise primarily with the aim of disposal in the short term or which are
                              included in a portfolio of financial instruments managed as a unit and with the purpose
                              of making a profit from short term price fluctuations or an arbitrage margin.
                              </p>
<p>Financial assets, provided they meet the conditions specified in the standard,
                              can
                              be designated as at fair value through profit or loss in the following three cases:
                              for hybrid instruments comprising one or more embedded derivatives, where the fair
                              value option would reduce an accounting mismatch or for a group of financial assets
                              under management whose performance is measured at fair value. This method is generally
                              used so that derivatives embedded in hybrid instruments do not have to be recognised
                              and measured separately.
                              </p>
<p>Securities that are classified under financial assets at fair value through profit
                              or loss are recognised at fair value at inception, excluding transaction costs attributable
                              directly to their acquisition (which are taken directly to profit or loss) and including
                              accrued interest.
                              </p>
<p>They are subsequently carried at fair value and changes in fair value are taken
                              to
                              profit or loss, as "Net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value through
                              profit or loss". No impairment losses are booked for this category of securities.
                              </p>
<p>Outstanding syndication securities held for sale are recognised as Financial assets
                              held for trading and are measured at fair value.

                              of interest rate risk for this category of securities is not allowed for hedge accounting

                              </p>
<p>They are subsequently measured at amortised cost with amortisation of any premium
                              or discount and transaction costs using the corrected effective interest method.
                              </p>

<p>Loans and receivables comprise unlisted financial assets that generate fixed or

<p>Securities of the Loans and receivables portfolio are initially recognised at acquisition

<p>IAS 39 defines "Available-for-sale financial assets" both as assets that are designated
                              as available-for-sale and as the default category.
                              </p>
<p>Securities designated as "Available-for-sale financial assets" are initially recognised
                              at fair value, with transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition
                              and including accrued interest.
                              </p>
<p>"Available-for-sale financial assets" are later measured at fair value and subsequent
                              changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income.
                              </p>
<p>In case of sale, these changes are transferred to the income statement, as net

                              SECURITIES</h4>
<p>Impairment shall be booked when there is objective evidence of impairment as a
                              result
                              of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the securities,
                              other than assets measured as at fair value through profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Objective evidence of loss corresponds to a prolonged or significant decline in
                              the
                              value of the security for equity securities or the appearance of significant deterioration
                              in credit risk evidenced by a risk of non-recovery for debt securities.
                              </p>
<p>For equity securities, Crédit Agricole CIB uses quantitative criteria as indicators
                              of potential impairment. These quantitative criteria are mainly based on a loss of
                              30% or more of the value of the equity instrument over a period of six consecutive
                              months. Crédit Agricole CIB may also take account of other factors such as financial
                              difficulties of the issuer, or short term prospects, etc.
                              </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above-mentioned criteria, Crédit Agricole CIB recognises an
                              impairment
                              loss when there is a decline in the value of the equity instrument, higher than 50%
                              or prolonged over three years.
                              </p>
<p>For debt securities, impairment criteria are the same as for loans and receivables.</p>
<p>Such impairment is only recognised when it translates into a probable loss of all
                              or part of the amount invested:

<p>Within the meaning of IAS 39, temporary sales of securities (securities lending/borrowing,
                              repurchase agreements) do not fulfil the derecognition conditions of IAS 39 and are
                              regarded as collateralised financing.
                              </p>
<p>Securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements remain on the balance sheet.
                              If
                              applicable, the amounts received, representing the liability to the transferee, are

                              </p>
<p>Items borrowed or bought under repurchase agreements are not recognised on the

                              </p>
<p>A receivable is recognised for the amount paid. If the security is subsequently
                              sold,
                              the transferee recognises a liability measured at fair value in respect of their obligation
                              to return the security under the repurchase agreement.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">LENDING OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>Loans are principally allocated to the Loans and receivables category. In accordance
                              with IAS 39, they are initially valued at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised
                              cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the
                              rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments to the original net loan
                              amount. This rate includes the discounts and any transaction income or costs that

<p>Impairment may be individual or collective, or in the form of discounts on loans

<p>Impairment charges and reversals of impairment losses for non-recovery risk are
                              recognised
                              in cost of risk and any increase in the carrying amount of the loan arising from the
                              accretion of the impairment or amortisation of the restructured loan discount is recognised
                              in net interest income. Impairment losses are discounted and estimated on the basis
                              of several factors, notably business - or sector-related. It is possible that future
                              assessments of the credit risk may differ significantly from current estimates, which
                              may lead to an increase or decrease in the amount of the impairment. Probable losses
                              in respect of off-balance sheet commitments are covered by provisions recognised as
                              liabilities.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Loans individually
                              assessed for impairment</h4>
<p>Each loan is first individually assessed for known risk of loss. Projected losses
                              are thus measured by means of individual impairment losses for all types of loans,
                              including guaranteed, where there is objective indication of impairment. The impaired
                              amount corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount of the loans (amortised
                              cost) and the sum of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective
                              interest rate.
                              </p>
<p>Possible losses in respect of portfolios of small loans with similar characteristics
                              may be estimated on a statistical basis rather than individually assessed.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Loans collectively
                              assessed for impairment</h4>
<p>Statistical and historical customer default experience shows that there is an identified
                              risk of partial uncollectibility of loans non-individually impaired. To cover these
                              risks, which cannot by nature be allocated to individual loans, Crédit Agricole CIB
                              takes various collective impairment losses, calculated using models developed on the
                              basis of these statistical data, by way of deduction from asset values. They are determined
                              for a homogeneous class of loans displaying similar credit risk characteristics.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Calculation of
                              impairment losses using Basel models</h4>
<p>Under Basel regulations, each Crédit Agricole CIB entity calculates the amount
                              of
                              losses anticipated within one year, using statistical tools and databases, based on
                              a variety of observation criteria that meet the definition of a "loss event" within
                              the meaning of IAS 39.
                              </p>
<p>The amount of impairment is based on the probability of default in each rating
                              class
                              assigned to borrowers, and also on Risk Management's experienced judgement. The amount
                              of this impairment is obtained by applying to the amount of anticipated losses calculated
                              using the Basel models a maturity correction factor designed to take account of the
                              need to record impairment charges for the anticipated losses up to maturity.

                              assessed for impairment</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB also sets aside collective impairment losses to cover customer
                              risks that are not allocated to individual loans, such as sector or country impairment
                              losses. These provisions are intended to cover estimated risks based on a sector or
                              geographical analysis for which there is statistical or historical risk of partial
                              non-recovery.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">LOAN RESTRUCTURING</h4>
<p>Loans restructured due to financial difficulties are loans for which the entity
                              changed
                              the initial financial terms (interest rate, term) for economic or legal reasons connected
                              with the borrower's financial difficulties, in a manner that would not have been considered
                              under other circumstances.
                              </p>

                              of a discount. It represents future loss of cash flow discounted at the original effective

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DETERMINATION
                              OF THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</h4>
<p>The fair value of financial instruments is measured by maximising the use of observable
                              input data. It is presented following the hierarchy defined in IFRS 13.
                              </p>
<p>IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
                              or
                              paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants,
                              on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the measurement date.
                              </p>
<p>Fair value applies separately to each financial asset and each financial liability.
                              A portfolio exemption may be used where the management and risk monitoring strategy
                              so allow and are appropriately documented. Hence, when a group of financial assets
                              and liabilities are managed on a net exposure basis to market and credit risks, some
                              parameters of the fair value are calculated on a net basis. This is the case for the
                              calculation of CVA, DVA and FVA.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB considers that the best evidence of fair value is quoted prices
                              published in an active market. When such quoted prices are not available, fair value
                              is established by using a valuation technique based on observable data or unobservable
                              inputs.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">FAIR VALUE OF
                              STRUCTURED ISSUES</h4>
<p>In accordance with IFRS 13, Crédit Agricole CIB values its structured issues, recognised
                              at fair value, by taking as a reference the issuer spread that specialist participants
                              agree to receive to acquire new Group issues.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">COUNTERPARTY RISK
                              ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB incorporates into fair value the assessment of counterparty
                              risk
                              for derivative assets (Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and, using a symmetrical
                              treatment, the non-performance risk for derivative liabilities (Debit Valuation Adjustment
                              or DVA or own credit risk).
                              </p>
<p>The CVA makes it possible to determine the expected losses due to the counterparty
                              from the perspective of Crédit Agricole CIB Group, and DVA the expected losses due
                              to Crédit Agricole CIB Group from the perspective of the counterparty.
                              </p>
<p>The CVA/DVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected losses based
                              on
                              the probability of default and loss given default. The methodology used maximises
                              the use of observable market inputs. It is primarily based on market data such as
                              registered and listed CDS (or Single Name CDS) or CDS proxy.

                              RELATED TO THE FUNDING OF DERIVATIVES</h4>
<p>The value of non-collateralised or partially collateralised derivative instruments
                              incorporates a Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) that represents costs and benefits
                              related to the financing of these instruments. This adjustment is measured based on
                              positive or negative future exposure of transactions for which a cost of financing
                              is applied.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY</h4>
<p>The standard classifies fair value into three levels based on the observability
                              of
                              inputs used in valuation techniques.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Level 1: fair
                              value corresponding to quoted prices (non-adjusted) in active markets</h4>
<p>Level 1 is composed of financial instruments that are directly quoted in active
                              markets
                              for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
                              date. These are stocks and bonds listed on active markets (such as the Paris Stock
                              Exchange, the London Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) and also fund
                              securities listed on an active market and derivatives traded on an organised market,
                              notably futures.
                              </p>
<p>A market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly
                              available
                              from an exchange, broker, dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those
                              prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length
                              basis. When current prices of financial instruments are unavailable at the reporting
                              date, Crédit Agricole CIB refers to the price of the most recent transactions involving
                              the financial instrument.
                              </p>
<p>For financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks, Crédit Agricole
                              CIB uses mid-prices as a basis for establishing fair values for the offsetting risk
                              positions. The Group applies the current bid price to asset held or liability to be
                              issued (open long position) and the current asking price to asset to be acquired or
                              liability held (open short position).

                              value that is measured using significant unobservable inputs</h4>
<p>For some complex instruments that are not traded in an active market, fair value
                              measurement
                              is based on valuation techniques using assumptions i.e. that cannot be observed on
                              the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are disclosed within Level
                              3.
                              </p>
<p>This mainly concerns complex interest rate instruments, equity derivatives, structured
                              credit instruments which fair value measurement includes for instance correlation
                              or volatility inputs that are not directly benchmarkable. Since the transaction price
                              is deemed to reflect the fair value at initial recognition, any day one gain or loss
                              recognition is deferred.

                              recognised through profit or loss over the period during which inputs are deemed unobservable.
                              When market data become "observable", the remaining margin to be deferred is immediately
                              recognised in profit or loss.

<p>Valuation methodologies and models used for financial instruments that are disclosed

                              right to offset the amounts reported and intends either to settle on a net basis,
                              or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

<p>At each reporting date, Crédit Agricole CIB Group sets aside reserves to cover
                              its
                              liabilities for retirement and similar benefits and all other employee benefits falling
                              in the category of defined-benefit plans.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 19, these commitments are stated based on a set of actuarial,
                              financial and demographic assumptions, and in accordance with the projected unit credit
                              method. Under this method, for each year of service, a charge is booked in an amount
                              corresponding to the employee's vested benefits for the period. The charge is calculated
                              based on the discounted future benefit.
                              </p>
<p>Liabilities for retirement and other employee benefits are based on assumptions
                              made
                              by management with respect to the discount rate, staff turnover rate and probable
                              increases in salary and social security costs. If the actual figures differ from the
                              assumptions made, the retirement liability may increase or decrease in future years
                              (see Note 7.4 "Post-employment benefits, defined-benefit plans").
                              </p>
<p>Discount rates are determined based on the average term of the commitment, that
                              is,
                              the arithmetical average of the terms calculated between the valuation date and the
                              payment date weighted by employee turnover assumptions.
                              </p>
<p>The anticipated return on plan assets is also estimated by management. Returns
                              are
                              estimated on the basis of expected returns on fixed income securities, and notably
                              bonds.
                              </p>
<p>The expected return on plan assets is determined using discount rates applied to
                              measure
                              the defined benefit obligation.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 19 revised, Crédit Agricole CIB recognises all actuarial

                              supplemented by the release issued by the CNC on 7 February 2007. Shares may be offered
                              to employees with a discount of no more than 20%. These plans have no vesting period
                              but the shares are subject to a lock-up period of five years. The benefit granted

                              DEFERRED TAX</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is 99.9% owned by Crédit Agricole Group since 27 December 1996
                              and some of its subsidiaries are part of the tax consolidation Group of Crédit Agricole
                              S.A.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 12, the income tax charge includes all income taxes, whether
                              current or deferred.
                              </p>
<p>IAS 12 defines current tax liability as "the amount of income tax payable (recoverable)
                              in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a reporting period". Taxable income
                              is the profit (or loss) for a given accounting period measured in accordance with
                              the rules determined by the taxation authorities.
                              </p>
<p>The applicable rates and rules used to measure the current tax liability are those
                              in effect in each country where the Group's companies are established.
                              </p>
<p>The current tax liability relates to any income due or that will become due, for
                              which
                              payment is not subordinated to the completion of future transactions, even if payment
                              is spread over several years.
                              </p>
<p>The current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If
                              the
                              amount that has already been paid for the current year and previous years exceeds
                              the amount due for these years, the surplus must be recognised under assets.
                              </p>
<p>Moreover, certain transactions carried out by the entity may have tax consequences
                              that are not taken into account in measuring the current tax liability. IAS 12 defines
                              a difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax basis
                              as a temporary difference.
                              </p>
<p>This standard requires that deferred taxes be recognised in the following cases.</p>
<p>A deferred tax liability should be recognised for any taxable temporary differences
                              between the carrying amount of an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its
                              tax base, unless the deferred tax liability arises from:

<p>A deferred tax asset should be recognised for any deductible temporary differences
                              between the carrying amount of an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its
                              tax base, insofar as it is deemed probable that a future taxable profit will be available
                              against which such deductible temporary differences can be allocated.
                              </p>
<p>A deferred tax asset should also be recognised for carrying forward unused tax
                              losses
                              and tax credits insofar as it is probable that a future taxable profit will be available
                              against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be allocated.
                              </p>
<p>The tax rates applicable in each country are used.</p>
<p>Deferred taxes are not discounted.</p>
<p>Taxable unrealised gains on securities do not generate any taxable temporary differences
                              between the carrying amount of the asset and the tax base. As a result, deferred tax
                              is not recognised on these gains. When the relevant securities are classified as available-for-sale
                              securities, unrealised gains and losses are recognised directly through other comprehensive
                              income. The tax charge or saving effectively borne by the entity arising from these
                              unrealised gains or losses is reclassified as a deduction from these gains.
                              </p>
<p>In France, all but 12% of long-term capital gains on the sale of equity investments,
                              as defined by the General Tax Code, are exempt from tax as from the tax year commencing
                              on 1 January 2007; the 12% of long term capital gains are taxed at the normally applicable
                              rate. Accordingly, unrealised gains recognised at the end of the year generate a temporary
                              difference requiring the recognition of deferred tax on this share.
                              </p>
<p>Current and deferred tax is recognised in net income for the year, unless the tax
                              arises from:

                              17)</h4>
<p>As required by IAS 17, leases are analysed in accordance with their substance and
                              financial reality. They are classified as operating leases or finance leases.
                              </p>
<p>Finance lease transactions are treated as an acquisition of a fixed asset by the
                              lessee
                              financed by a loan from the lessor. In the lessor's financial statements, analysis

<p>In the lessee's financial statements, finance leases are restated such that they
                              are
                              recognised in the same way as if the asset had been purchased on credit, by recognising
                              a financial liability, recording the purchased asset under assets and depreciating
                              the asset.
                              </p>
<p>In the income statement, the theoretical depreciation charge (the charge that would
                              have been recognised if the asset had been purchased) and the finance expenses (incurred
                              in connection with the financing) are recorded in the place of the lease payments.
                              </p>
<p>For operating leases, the lessee recognises payments as expenses and the lessor
                              records
                              the corresponding income under rents, and the leased assets on its balance sheet.

                              ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (IFRS 5)</h4>
<p>A non-current asset (or a disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its
                              carrying
                              amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
                              continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available
                              for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable.
                              </p>
<p>The relevant assets and liabilities are shown separately on the balance sheet under
                              Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations and Liabilities associated
                              with non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations.
                              </p>
<p>A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale is measured
                              at
                              the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs of sale. A charge for impairment
                              of unrealised gains is recognised in the income statement. Unrealised gains are no
                              longer amortised when they are reclassified.
                              </p>
<p>If the fair value of a disposal group less selling costs is under its carrying
                              amount
                              after impairment of non-current assets, the difference is allocated to other disposal
                              group assets including the financial assets and is recognised under net income of
                              held-for-sale operations.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DEFINITIONS OF
                              CONTROL</h4>
<p>In compliance with international standards, all entities under control, under joint
                              control or under significant influence are consolidated, provided that they are not
                              covered by the exclusions below.
                              </p>
<p>Exclusive control over an entity is deemed to exist if Crédit Agricole CIB is exposed
                              to or entitled to receive variable returns as a result of its involvement with the
                              entity and if the power it holds over this entity allows it to influence these returns.
                              Power in this context means substantive (voting or contractual) rights. Rights are
                              considered substantive if the holder of the rights can in practice exercise them when
                              decisions about the company's relevant activities are made.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is deemed to control a subsidiary through voting rights when
                              its
                              rights give it the practical ability to direct the subsidiary's relevant activities.
                              Crédit Agricole CIB is generally considered to control a subsidiary when it holds
                              more than half the existing or potential voting rights in an entity, whether directly
                              or indirectly through subsidiaries, except when it can be clearly demonstrated that
                              such ownership does not give it the power to direct its relevant activities. Control
                              is also deemed to exist where Crédit Agricole CIB holds half or less than half of
                              the voting rights, including potential rights, in an entity but is able in practice
                              to direct its relevant activities at its sole discretion, notably because of the existence
                              of contractual arrangements, the size of its stake in the voting rights compared to
                              those of other investors, or other reasons.
                              </p>
<p>Control of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of voting rights as
                              these
                              have no effect on the entity's returns. When assessing control, consideration is given
                              not only to contractual arrangements in force but also to whether Crédit Agricole
                              CIB was involved in creating the entity and what decisions it made at the time, what
                              agreements were made at its inception and what risks are borne by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, any rights under agreements that give the investor the power to direct relevant
                              activities in specific circumstances only and any other facts or circumstances that
                              indicate the investor can direct the entity's relevant activities. Where there is
                              a management agreement, the extent of decision-making powers granted to the delegated
                              manager and the compensation accorded by such contractual agreements are examined
                              to establish whether the manager is in practice acting as an agent (with delegated
                              powers) or as a principal (on their own account). Furthermore, when decisions on the
                              entity's relevant activities are taken, the indicators used to assess whether an entity
                              is acting as agent or principal are as follows: the extent of the decision-making
                              powers compared to the powers over the entity delegated to the manager, the compensation
                              provided for under the contractual agreements, any substantive rights that may affect
                              the decision-making capacity of other parties involved in the entity and the exposure
                              to variable returns of other interests in the entity.
                              </p>
<p>Joint control is deemed to exist when there is a contractual division of control
                              over
                              an economic activity. Decisions affecting the entity's relevant activities require
                              unanimous agreement of the joint controllers.
                              </p>
<p>In traditional entities, significant influence is defined as the power to influence
                              but not control a company's financial and operational policies. Crédit Agricole CIB

                              COMBINATIONS - GOODWILL (IFRS 3)</h4>
<p>Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance
                              with IFRS 3, except for business combinations under common control which are excluded
                              from the field of application of IFRS 3. Pursuant to IAS 8, these transactions are
                              entered at carrying amount using the pooling of interests method, with reference to
                              US standard ASU805-50 which seems to comply with the IFRS general principles.
                              </p>
<p>On the date of acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
                              liabilities
                              of the acquired entity which satisfy the conditions for recognition set out in IFRS
                              3 are recognised at their fair value.
                              </p>
<p>Notably, restructuring liabilities are only recognised as a liability of the acquired
                              entity if, at the date of acquisition, the acquiree is under an obligation to complete
                              the restructuring. Price adjustment clauses are recognised at fair value even if their
                              application is not probable. Subsequent changes in the fair value of clauses if they
                              are financial liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Only price adjustment
                              clauses relating to transactions where control was obtained at the latest by 31 December
                              2009 may still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were accounted
                              for under IFRS 3 pre-revision (2004).

<p>The transferred consideration at the time of a business combination (the acquisition

                              liabilities taken over, valued at their fair value is recognised, when it is positive,
                              in the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet, under the heading "Goodwill"
                              when the acquired entity is fully consolidated and in the heading "Investments in

                              method of accounting. Any negative goodwill is recognised immediately through profit
                              or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at its initial amount in the currency
                              of
                              the acquired entity and translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting
                              period.
                              </p>
<p>When control is taken by stages, the interest held before taking control is revaluated
                              at fair value through profit or loss at the date of acquisition and the goodwill is
                              calculated once, using the fair value at the date of acquisition of acquired assets
                              and liabilities taken over.
                              </p>
<p>Goodwill is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence of a loss
                              of
                              value and at least once a year.

<p>The choices and assumptions used in assessing the holdings that do not allow control
                              at the date of acquisition may influence the amount of initial goodwill and any impairment
                              resulting from a loss of value.
                              </p>
<p>For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group Cash
                              Generating
                              Units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The CGUs
                              have been defined within the Group's business lines as the smallest identifiable group
                              of assets and liabilities functioning in a single business model. Impairment testing
                              consists of comparing the carrying amount of each CGU, including any goodwill allocated
                              to it, with its recoverable amount.
                              </p>
<p>The recoverable amount of the CGU is defined as the higher of fair value diminished
                              of selling costs and value in use. The value in use is the present value of the future
                              cash flows of the CGU, as set out in medium-term business plans prepared by the Group
                              for management purposes.
                              </p>
<p>When the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, a corresponding
                              impairment
                              loss is recognised for the goodwill allocated to the CGU. This impairment is irreversible.

                              shareholders, which in accordance with the provisions of IAS 32, means that the minority
                              interests are treated as a liability rather than as shareholders' equity.

                              CRÉDIT AGRICOLE SECURITIES TAIWAN</h4>
<p>On 31 July 2013, Credit Agricole CIB Group withdrew from the brokerage business,
                              with
                              notably the disposal of the CLSA BV Group to Citics International by CASA BV. Since
                              Taiwanese law prohibits ownership of more than 30% of a Taiwanese company by Chinese
                              (PRC) interests, CLSA's operations in Taiwan were hived off and sold to Credit Agricole
                              Securities Asia BV. In the CLSA BV sale contract, Credit Agricole Securities Asia
                              BV had agreed to maintain brokerage operations in Taiwan for two years. During the
                              second quarter of 2015, a contract was signed selling the shares to a new third counterparty.
                              The sale, approved by the local regulator and later finalised on 31 May 2016, led
                              to a non-material capital gain.

                              RESOLUTION FUND</h4>
<p>The Single Resolution Fund (SRF) was established by Regulation (EU) No 806/2014
                              as
                              a single funding mechanism for all Member States participating in the Single Supervisory

                              Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRF is financed by the banking sector. The target
                              level of the Fund is 1% of the amount of deposits covered by the Deposit Guarantee
                              Fund and must be reached by 31 December 2023.
                              </p>
<p>85% of the contribution to the resolution fund is payable in cash, in the form
                              of
                              an annual contribution. The remaining 15% is the subject of an irrevocable payment
                              commitment, collateralised through a cash security deposit held by the Fund. The deposit
                              will be held for the duration of the commitment. It is repayable at maturity.
                              </p>
<p>Thus, for the 2016 financial year, Crédit Agricole CIB group paid €140 million
                              in
                              respect of the annual contribution, as opposed to €77 million for year ended 31 December

<p>97.33% owned by Crédit Agricole S.A. (CASA), whether directly or indirectly, Crédit
                              Agricole CIB (CACIB) is part of the tax consolidation group constituted by CASA and
                              is head of the CACIB tax sub-group constituted with the member subsidiaries of the
                              tax consolidation group.
                              </p>
<p>Under the terms of the tax consolidation convention, the losses of the CACIB sub-group
                              were, until 31 December 2015, compensated by CASA up to the limit of CACIB's integrated
                              individual losses.
                              </p>
<p>A revision of the tax consolidation convention in 2016 stipulates the compensation
                              by CASA of the losses generated as of 1 January 2016 by all the subsidiaries in the
                              CACIB subgroup and the monetisation of the tax loss carryforwards of the CACIB sub-group
                              at that date.

<p>The income tax charge for the financial year reflects the consequences of the revised

<p>iii. and, consequently, the cancellation of our Deferred tax assets regarding CASA;</p>
<p>iv. recognition in the consolidated financial statements of a deferred tax liability
                              on losses generated by non-consolidated member subsidiaries of the tax group to materialise
                              CACIB's obligation to repay the sums.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">▶︎ 2.4 EURIBOR/LIBOR</h4>
<p>On 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly fined Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and
                              Crédit Agricole CIB €114.7 million over Euribor. This payment must be made within
                              three months of notification of the decision, namely on 8 March 2017 at the latest.
                              The Commission does not specify how it should be allocated between Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB and leaves it up to them to contractually agree the portion
                              of the fine allocated to each, in line with European Court of Justice case law.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB, which are challenging this decision,
                              have decided to petition the European Court of Justice to overturn it. Various procedural
                              and substantive arguments will be put forward to support the appeal. Therefore, even
                              though the fine is immediately payable it may be overturned.
                              </p>
<p>Pending the decision of the European Court (see Note "6.18 Provisions"), Crédit
                              Agricole
                              S.A. decided to provisionally pay the full amount of the fine.
                              </p>
<p>It should be recalled that Crédit Agricole S.A. is, as central body, responsible
                              for
                              the liquidity and solvency of all its affiliates including Crédit Agricole CIB.

<p>A fair value hedge modifies the risk caused by changes in the fair value of a fixed-rate
                              financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates. Fair value hedges transform

                              are principally fixed-rate loans, securities, deposits and subordinated debt.

                              The theoretical tax rate is the standard tax rate (including the additional social

                              THE FRENCH CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 2019/2020</h4>
<p>The 2017 Finance Act and the 2016 Amending Finance Act were published in the Official
                              Journal on 30 December 2016. This 2017 Finance Act provides for a cut in the prevailing
                              corporate income tax rate for years ending as from 31 December 2020 or 31 December
                              2019 for entities with Revenues of less than one billion euros. The prevailing tax
                              rate will then be 28.92%.
                              </p>
<p>As a result, the deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2016 were measured

<p>The scope of sovereign exposures recorded covers exposures to Government, but does

<p>The issue of subordinated debt plays a part in regulatory capital management while
                              contributing to refinancing all of Crédit Agricole CIB's operations.
                              </p>
<p>The Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRD 4/CRR) define the conditions
                              under which subordinated instruments qualify as regulatory capital and set out the
                              terms and conditions of progressive disqualification between 1 January 2014 (effective
                              date of the CRD 4/CRR) and 1 January 2022 of older instruments that do not meet these
                              requirements.
                              </p>

<p>Under the terms of the revised tax consolidation convention in France between CASA/CACIB

                              CACIB sub-group, a receivable of €1,076 million to CASA was recognised at 31 December
                              2016, while the amount of deferred tax assets recognised at 31 December 2015 of €937
                              million was written back. Therefore, whereas in "Other temporary differences", the

                              2016, they had previously been deducted from the deferred tax assets in the same aggregation
                              at 31 December 2015 for a total of €975 million.

                              December 2016. This value may not be representative of the selling value since the
                              value in use of equity-accounted entities may be different from the equity-accounted
                              value determined pursuant to IAS 28. Investments in equity-accounted entities were
                              subject to impairment tests using the same methodology as for goodwill, i.e., by using
                              expected future cash flow estimates of the companies in question and by using the
                              valuation parameters described in Note 6.17 "Goodwill".

                              and its parent company Crédit Agricole S.A. reached agreements with the US and New

                              with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement
                              took place between 2003 and 2008.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and Crédit Agricole S.A., which cooperated with the US and

                              York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total
                              penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e. €692.7 million). The payment of this penalty
                              has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore,
                              has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.

<p>The agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal

                              (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Crédit Agricole CIB. Crédit Agricole
                              CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United

                              authorities regarding this matter, with its home regulators, the European Central
                              Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with

                              AND OTHER INDICES</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole CIB) and its parent
                              company Crédit Agricole S.A., in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank
                              rates, have received requests for information from a number of authorities as part
                              of investigations into: (i) the calculation of the Libor (London Interbank Offered
                              Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and certain
                              other market indices; and (ii) transactions connected with these rates and indices.
                              These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its cooperation with the authorities, Crédit Agricole CIB and its parent
                              company Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out investigations in order to gather the information
                              requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities -
                              the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with
                              which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of
                              these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Crédit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation opened by the
                              Attorney
                              General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>Following its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21 May
                              2014,
                              the European Commission sent a notification of grievances to Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and to Crédit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the
                              purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives
                              related to the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>In a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly fined Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB €114.654 million for participating in a cartel
                              in euro interest rate derivatives. Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are
                              challenging this decision and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn
                              it.
                              </p>
<p>Additionally, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, is conducting an investigation
                              into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB along with several Swiss and international
                              banks. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition authority (KFTC) decided
                              to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Crédit Agricole CIB and
                              the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and Tibor indices. The KFTC investigation
                              into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) is ongoing.

                              and Crédit Agricole CIB have been named, since 2012 and 2013, along with other financial
                              institutions - both are defendants in one ("Sullivan" for the Euribor) and only Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ("Lieberman" for the Libor) are still at
                              the preliminary stage of consideration of admissibility.
                              </p>
<p>"Lieberman" class action is currently suspended for procedural reasons in front
                              of
                              the US District Court of New York State. For the "Sullivan" class action, Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to dismiss.
                              </p>
<p>Since 1 July 2016, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB, together with
                              other
                              banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ("Frontpoint")
                              relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer
                              Rate) indices. Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to
                              dismiss.
                              </p>
<p>These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim that they are
                              victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor, SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek
                              repayment of the sums they allege were unlawfully received, as well as damages and
                              reimbursement of costs and fees paid.

                              relative to activities of different banks involved on Bonds SSA market (Supranational,
                              Sub-Sovereign and Agencies). Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are included
                              with other banks in various consolidated class actions before the United States District
                              Court for the Southern District of New York. Through the cooperation with these regulators,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB has been proceeding to intern inquiries to gather the required
                              information. This work will continue in 2017. It is not possible at this stage to
                              predict the outcome of these investigations or class actions or the date on which

                              OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY CONTRACTUAL MATURITY</h4>
<p>The breakdown of balance sheet financial assets and liabilities is made according
                              to contractual maturity date. The maturities of derivative instruments held for trading
                              and for hedging correspond to their date of contractual maturity.
                              </p>
<p>Equities and other variable-income securities are by nature without maturity; they
                              are classified as "Indefinite".

                              BENEFITS, DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS</h4>
<p>There are various mandatory pension schemes to which employers contribute. The
                              funds
                              are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal
                              or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have sufficient
                              assets to provide all the benefits corresponding to the services rendered by staff
                              during the current and previous years.
                              </p>
<p>Consequently, there is no liability in this respect other than the contributions
                              payable.</p>
<p>Within Crédit Agricole CIB, there are several compulsory defined-contribution plans,
                              the main ones being Agirc/Arrco, which are French supplementary retirement plans,
                              notably supplemented by an "Article 83" type plan.

                              APPLIED BY CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CIB</h4>
<p>Reclassifications not included in the categories "Financial assets held-for-trading"
                              and "Available-for-sale financial assets" were decided upon and implemented in accordance
                              with IAS 39 amendment, adopted by the European Union on 15 October 2008. They were
                              entered in the new accounting category at fair value on the reclassification date.

                              CARRIED OUT BY CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CIB</h4>
<p>Pursuant to the IAS 39 amendment published and adopted by the European Union on
                              15
                              October 2008, Crédit Agricole CIB made reclassifications in 2016 as allowed by the
                              IAS 39 amendment. Information on these and previous reclassifications is shown below.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">TYPE, REASON AND
                              AMOUNT OF RECLASSIFICATIONS</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB carried out reclassifications in 2016 from the category "Financial
                              assets at fair value through profit or loss" to the category "Loans and receivables".
                              </p>
<p>Reclassifications in prior years concern reclassifications from "Available-for-sale
                              financial assets" and "Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss" to
                              "Loans and receivables".
                              </p>
<p>For the assets reclassified in 2016, the table below shows their value on the reclassification
                              date as well as their value at 31 December 2016, as well as the value, at 31 December
                              2016, of assets previously reclassified and still in Crédit Agricole CIB assets at

                              VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</h4>
<p>Fair value is the price that would be received at the sale of an asset or paid
                              to
                              transfer a liability in an arm's length transaction between market participants at
                              the valuation date.
                              </p>
<p>Fair value is defined on the basis of an exit price.</p>
<p>The fair values shown below are estimates made on the reporting date using observable
                              market data wherever possible. These are subject to change in subsequent periods due
                              to developments in market conditions or other factors.
                              </p>
<p>The calculations represent best estimates. They are based on a number of assumptions.
                              It is assumed that market participants act in their best economic interest.
                              </p>
<p>To the extent that these models contain uncertainties, the fair values shown may
                              not
                              be achieved upon actual sale or immediate settlement of the financial instruments
                              concerned. The fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities is broken
                              down according to the general observability criteria of the valuation inputs, pursuant
                              to the principles defined under IFRS 13.
                              </p>
<p>Level 1 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities quoted in
                              active
                              markets.
                              </p>
<p>Level 2 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities with observable
                              inputs. This includes, in particular, market data relating to interest rate risk or
                              credit risk when the latter can be revalued based on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) prices.
                              Repurchase agreements with underlyings quoted in an active market are also included
                              in level 2 of the hierarchy, as are financial assets with a demand component for which
                              fair value is measured at unadjusted amortised cost.
                              </p>
<p>Level 3 indicates the fair value of financial assets and liabilities with unobservable
                              inputs or for which some data can be revalued using internal models based on historical
                              data. This includes, in particular, market data relating to credit risk or early redemption
                              risk.
                              </p>
<p>In some cases, market values are close to carrying amounts. This applies primarily
                              to:

                              to incorporate those factors, as well as the potential uncertainties inherent in the
                              models or inputs used. The main types of valuation adjustments are the following:

<p>Level 1 comprises all derivatives quoted in an active market (options, futures,

                              regardless of their underlying (interest rate, exchange rate, precious metals, key
                              stock indices), as well as equities and bonds quoted in an active market.
                              </p>

                              CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3</h4>
<p>Financial instruments classified in level 3 are those which do not meet the conditions
                              for classification in level 1 or 2. They are therefore mainly financial instruments
                              with a high model risk whose valuation requires substantial use of unobservable inputs.
                              </p>
<p>The initial margin on all new transactions classified in level 3 is reserved at
                              the
                              date of initial recognition. It is reintegrated in the profit or loss account either
                              spread over the period during which the inputs are considered to be unobservable or
                              in full on the date when the inputs become observable.
                              </p>
<p>Level 3 therefore mainly includes:</p>

<p>As regards interest rate derivatives, two key inputs are considered to be unobservable
                              and require products valued on this basis to be classified in level 3: correlation
                              and prepayment rates (i.e. early redemption).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Correlation</h4>

<p>The biggest source of correlation exposure is, within the Non-Linear business line,
                              the cross asset business.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Prepayment rate</h4>
<p>The prepayment rate is the rate of early repayment on securitisation portfolios,
                              whether
                              voluntary or involuntary (default). Exposure to this risk factor can stem from two
                              types of sources: firstly, direct exposure to these asset classes and, secondly, certain
                              so-called "securitisation" swaps, i.e. where changes in the nominal amount automatically
                              adjust to the nominal amount of the underlying portfolio, with no mark-to-market payment.
                              The prepayment rate plays a significant part in their valuation.

<p>The result of the stress test is then obtained by adding up the absolute values

                              For each correlation type, we took the absolute values by currency and by book, therefore
                              assuming that the correlations were not correlated among themselves. For the CMS correlations,
                              we considered the various underlyings independently (e.g. 1y10y, 2y10y).

<p>At 31 December 2016, the sensitivity to the inputs used in the interest rate derivative

                              2015 (+/-€6.7 million). There are no longer any Legacy activities, the transactions

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">With respect to
                              the prepayment rate</h4>
<p>Direct exposure to assets comprising a prepayment risk concerns securitisations
                              such
                              as RMBS and CLO and mezzanine CDO tranches. These exposures are marginal. They can
                              be taken into account through sensitivity to a 1 bp change in credit spreads. This
                              sensitivity being very low (&lt; €50K/bp), exposure to prepayment rate is thus considered
                              to be negligible.
                              </p>
<p>The prepayment rate is not an observable market input and the valuation model used
                              for the securitisation swaps is particularly conservative. The valuation used is defined
                              as the lower of the valuation obtained using a very fast prepayment rate and using
                              a very slow prepayment rate. A "normal" variance in the prepayment rate will therefore
                              have no material impact on mark-to-market, no Day One thus being used for these products.

<p>The Statutory Auditors' report includes information specifically required by French

                              opinion on the consolidated financial statements. This information includes an explanatory
                              paragraph discussing the auditors' assessments of certain significant accounting and
                              auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">I. OPINION ON
                              THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h4>
<p>We have conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable
                              in
                              France. Those standards require that we plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable
                              assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
                              An audit consists of examining, on the basis of tests and other selection methods,
                              evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
                              An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
                              made in the preparation of the financial statements and evaluating their overall presentation.
                              We believe that the evidence we have collected is relevant and sufficient for the
                              formation of our opinion.
                              </p>
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
                              of
                              the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of the companies and entities
                              included in the consolidated Group in accordance with the IFRS standards as adopted
                              in the European Union.

                              CIB to account for loans with a risk of arrears in accordance with the following rules.
                              External and/or internal rating systems are used to help assess whether there is a
                              credit risk.

                              LOANS</h4>
<p>These are loans to counterparties in financial difficulty, such that the bank alters
                              their initial characteristics (term, interest rate, etc.) to allow counterparties
                              to honour the repayment schedule.
                              </p>
<p>They consist of loans classified as in default and performing loans at the date
                              they
                              are restructured.
                              </p>
<p>Restructured loans do not include loans whose characteristics have been renegotiated
                              on a commercial basis with counterparties not showing any insolvency problems.
                              </p>
<p>The reduction of future flows granted to a counterparty, or the postponing of these
                              flows as part of a restructuring, results in the recognition of a discount. It represents
                              future loss of cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate. It is
                              equal to the difference between:

<p>The discount recognised when a loan is restructured is recorded under cost of risk.
                              Its amortisation then affects the interest margin.
                              </p>
<p>Restructured loans are rated in accordance with Basel rules and are impaired on
                              the
                              basis of the estimated credit risk. They are individually impaired within thirty days
                              of a missed payment.

<p>Loans and advances of all kinds, even those that are guaranteed, are classified
                              as
                              doubtful if they carry an identified credit risk on an individual basis arising from

<p>Subject to certain conditions, in lieu of the above criteria, the bank may calculate

                              for total or partial repayment of the overdraft by the borrower.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB makes a distinction between doubtful and bad debts.</p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DOUBTFUL LOANS</h4>
<p>All doubtful loans which do not fall into the bad debts category are classified
                              as
                              doubtful loans.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">BAD DEBTS</h4>
<p>Bad debts are those for which the prospects of recovery are highly impaired and
                              which
                              are likely to be written off in time.
                              </p>
<p>In the case of doubtful loans, interest continues to be recognised so long as the
                              receivable is deemed to be doubtful, but is no longer recognised after the loss has
                              been transferred to bad debts.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; 1.1.3 IMPAIRMENT
                              RESULTING FROM INDIVIDUALLY ASSESSED CREDIT RISK</h4>
<p>Once a loan is classified as doubtful, an impairment loss is deducted by Crédit
                              Agricole
                              CIB from the asset in an amount equal to the probable loss. These impairment losses
                              represent the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and estimated
                              future cash flows discounted at the contractual rate, taking into account the borrower's
                              financial condition, its business prospects and any guarantees, after deducting the
                              cost of enforcing such guarantees.
                              </p>
<p>Possible losses in respect of portfolios of small loans with similar characteristics
                              may be estimated on a statistical basis rather than individually assessed.
                              </p>
<p>Probable losses in respect off-balance sheet commitments are covered by provisions
                              recognised as liabilities.
                              </p>

                              TREATMENT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES</h4>
<p>Impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses for non-recovery risk on doubtful
                              loans are recognised in cost of risk and any increase in the carrying amount resulting
                              from the reversal of impairment losses as a result of the passage of time is recognised
                              in the interest margin.
                              </p>

                              risk provisions or sector provisions calculated based on Basel models. These provisions
                              are designed to cover identified risks for which there is a statistical or historical
                              probability of partial non-recovery against loans classified as performing or not
                              individually impaired.

                              the countries listed by the French Prudential and Resolution Supervisory Authority
                              (ACPR), or for which the successful settlement depends on the situation of private

<p>Impairment is not booked for long term investment securities if their market value

                              Transactions"
                              of Book II "Special Transactions") of ANC Regulation 2014-07 of 26 November 2014,
                              these securities are "investments made on a normal basis, with the sole aim of securing
                              a capital gain in the medium term, with no intention of investing in the issuer's
                              business on a long-term basis or taking an active part in its management".
                              </p>
<p>Securities can only be included in this category if the activity is carried out
                              to
                              a significant extent and on an ongoing basis within a structured framework and gives
                              the reporting entity a recurring return mainly in the form of capital gains on disposals.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB meets these conditions and some of its securities can be classified
                              in this category.
                              </p>
<p>Medium term portfolio securities are recorded at purchase price, including transaction
                              expenses.
                              </p>
<p>They are recognised at the end of the reporting period at the lower of historical
                              cost or value in use, which is determined on the basis of the issuer's general outlook
                              and the estimated remaining time horizon for holding the securities.
                              </p>
<p>For listed companies, value in use is generally the average quoted price over a
                              sufficiently
                              long period of time, depending on the estimated time horizon for holding the securities,
                              to mitigate the impact of substantial fluctuations in stock prices.
                              </p>
<p>Impairment losses are booked for any unrealised losses calculated for each line
                              of
                              securities, and are not offset against any unrealized gains. Unrealised losses are
                              recorded under "Net gains or losses on short term investment portfolios" along with
                              impairment losses and reversals on these securities.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB applies component accounting for all of its property, plant
                              and
                              equipment. In accordance with this method, the depreciable base takes account of the

<p>ANC Regulation 2015-06 changes the way in which technical merger losses are recognised
                              on the balance sheet and monitored in the financial statements. Losses are no longer
                              required to be comprehensively and systematically recognised under "Goodwill"; they
                              must be recognised in the balance sheet depending on asset items to which they are
                              allocated as "Other property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and financial
                              assets, etc.". The loss is amortised, impaired and written off in the same way as
                              the underlying asset.
                              </p>
<p>The acquisition cost of fixed assets includes the purchase price plus any incidental
                              expenses, namely expenses directly or indirectly incurred in connection with bringing
                              the asset into service or "into inventory".
                              </p>
<p>Land is stated at acquisition cost.</p>
<p>Buildings and equipment are stated at acquisition-cost less accumulated depreciation,

                              </p>
<p>Purchased software is measured at purchase price less accumulated depreciation,
                              amortisation
                              and any impairment losses since acquisition.
                              </p>
<p>Proprietary software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation
                              and impairment losses booked since completion.
                              </p>
<p>Intangible assets other than software, patents and licences are not amortised.
                              They
                              may be subject to impairment.
                              </p>
<p>Fixed assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.</p>
<p>The following components and depreciation periods have been adopted by Crédit Agricole
                              CIB following the application of component accounting for fixed assets. These depreciation
                              periods are adjusted according to the type of asset and its location.

                              the recognition and measurement of provisions.
                              </p>
<p>Provisions include provisions relating to financing commitments, retirement and
                              early
                              retirement liabilities, litigations and various risks.
                              </p>
<p>The provisions also include country risks. All these risks are reviewed quarterly.</p>
<p>Provisions are set aside for country risks following an analysis of the types of
                              transactions,
                              the term of commitments, their form (receivables, securities, market products) as

                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB partially hedges provisions on these foreign-currency-denominated
                              receivables by buying foreign currency, to limit the impact of changes in exchange

                              CIB
                              makes a Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) to the market value of its derivative assets
                              to reflect counterparty risk. For this reason, Credit Valuation Adjustments are only
                              made to derivatives recognised as isolated open positions and as part of a trading
                              portfolio (derivatives classified in categories "a" and "d" of Article 2522-1, respectively
                              of the aforementioned regulation).
                              </p>
<p>The CVA makes it possible to calculate counterparty losses expected by Crédit Agricole

                              </p>
<p>The CVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected losses based on the

                              types and valuation methods. These transactions are recognised as a single batch or
                              as a transaction whose recognition is not governed by any explicit regulations, with
                              the result that it is up to Crédit Agricole CIB to choose an accounting policy.
                              </p>
<p>The purpose is to reflect the economic reality of the transaction in accordance
                              with
                              the principles of fair presentation and substance over form.

<p>At each reporting date, forward foreign exchange transactions are measured at the

                              Agricole CIB has instituted multi-currency accounting to enable it to monitor its
                              currency position and to measure its exposure to foreign exchange risk.
                              </p>

<p>At each period end, spot foreign exchange contracts are valued at the spot exchange
                              rate of the currency concerned.
                              </p>
<p>Forward foreign exchange transactions categorised as trading transactions are recognised

                              </p>
<p>Net gains and losses on forward foreign exchange transactions that are categorised
                              as spot exchange transactions in connection with loans and borrowings, are recognised
                              on a prorate basis over the period of the contracts.

                              of
                              7 November 2013 relating to the measurement and recognition of retirement and similar
                              benefits obligations, such recommendation having then been repealed and incorporated
                              in section 4 of chapter II of part III of ANC Regulation 2014-03 of 5 June 2014.
                              </p>
<p>In application of this regulation, Crédit Agricole CIB sets aside reserves to cover
                              its liabilities for retirement and similar benefits falling within the category of
                              defined-benefit plans.
                              </p>
<p>These obligations are stated on the basis of actuarial, financial and demographic
                              assumptions, and following the Projected Unit Credit method. This method consists
                              in booking a charge for each period of service, for an amount corresponding to employee's
                              vested benefits for the period. This charge is calculated based on the discounted
                              future benefit.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB has decided to recognize actuarial gains and losses immediately

                              during the current and previous years.
                              </p>
<p>As a consequence, Crédit Agricole CIB has no liability in this respect other that

                              C of the French General Tax Code) as a reduction in employee expenses rather than
                              a tax reduction.

<p>Crédit Agricole CIB is currently the object of an audit of accounts covering years
                              2013, 2014 and 2015. An adjustment notice suspending the limitation period was received
                              late 2016. Crédit Agricole CIB is challenging the proposed adjustments. A provision
                              has been recognised to cover the estimated risk.

<p>In October 2015, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole
                              CIB)
                              and its parent company Crédit Agricole S.A. reached agreements with the US and New
                              York authorities that had been conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions
                              with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement
                              took place between 2003 and 2008.
                              </p>
<p>Crédit Agricole CIB and Crédit Agricole S.A., which cooperated with the US and
                              New
                              York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total
                              penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e. €692.7 million). The payment of this penalty
                              has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore,
                              has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.
                              </p>
<p>The agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal
                              Reserve) and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with
                              CASA and Crédit Agricole CIB. The agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control
                              (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Crédit Agricole CIB. Crédit Agricole
                              CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United
                              States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney
                              of the County of New York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. The USAO and
                              DANY have agreed to take no further action against Crédit Agricole CIB, CASA, or any
                              of Crédit Agricole CIB's subsidiaries or affiliates regarding the conduct subject
                              to this investigation if Crédit Agricole CIB complies with its obligations under the
                              DPAs.
                              </p>
<p>Within the framework of the implementation of these agreements, Crédit Agricole
                              continues
                              to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programs regarding laws on
                              international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York
                              authorities regarding this matter, with its home regulators, the European Central
                              Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with
                              the other regulators across its worldwide network.

<p>Pursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Crédit Agricole's
                              compliance program will be subject to regular reviews to evaluate its effectiveness,
                              including a review by an independent consultant who will be appointed by NYDFS for
                              a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent consultant approved by the
                              Federal Reserve.

                              AND OTHERS INDICES</h4>
<p>Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole CIB) and its parent
                              company Crédit Agricole S.A., in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank
                              rates, have received requests for information from a number of authorities as part
                              of investigations into: (i) the calculation of the Libor (London Interbank Offered
                              Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and certain
                              other market indices; and (ii) transactions connected with these rates and indices.
                              These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.
                              </p>
<p>As part of its cooperation with the authorities, Crédit Agricole CIB and its parent
                              company Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out investigations in order to gather the information
                              requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities -
                              the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with
                              which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of
                              these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Crédit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation opened by the
                              Attorney
                              General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>Following its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21 May
                              2014,
                              the European Commission sent a notification of grievances to Crédit Agricole S.A.
                              and to Crédit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the
                              purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives
                              related to the Euribor.
                              </p>
<p>In a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly fined Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB €114.654 million for participating in a cartel
                              in euro interest rate derivatives. Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are
                              challenging this decision and have asked the European Court of Justice to overturn
                              it.
                              </p>
<p>Additionally, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, is conducting an investigation
                              into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard
                              to Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB along with several Swiss and international
                              banks. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition authority (KFTC) decided
                              to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Crédit Agricole CIB and
                              the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and Tibor indices. The KFTC investigation
                              into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) is ongoing.
                              </p>
<p>The two class actions in the United States of America in which Crédit Agricole
                              S.A.
                              and Crédit Agricole CIB have been named, since 2012 and 2013, along with other financial
                              institutions - both are defendants in one ("Sullivan" for the Euribor) and only Crédit
                              Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ("Lieberman" for the Libor) are still at
                              the preliminary stage of consideration of admissibility.
                              </p>
<p>"Lieberman" class action is currently suspended for procedural reasons in front
                              of
                              the US District Court of New York State. For the "Sullivan" class action, Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to dismiss.
                              </p>
<p>Since 1 July 2016, Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB, together with
                              other
                              banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ("Frontpoint")
                              relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer
                              Rate) indices. Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB have filed a motion to
                              dismiss.
                              </p>
<p>These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim that they are
                              victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor, SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek
                              repayment of the sums they allege were unlawfully received, as well as damages and
                              reimbursement of costs and fees paid.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">&gt; BONDS SSA</h4>
<p>Several regulators have demanded information to Crédit Agricole CIB for inquiries
                              relative to activities of different banks involved on Bonds SSA market (Supranational,
                              Sub-Sovereign and Agencies). Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole CIB are included
                              with other banks in various consolidated class actions before the United States District
                              Court for the Southern District of New York. Through the cooperation with these regulators,
                              Crédit Agricole CIB has been proceeding to intern inquiries to gather the required
                              information. This work will continue in 2017. It is not possible at this stage to
                              predict the outcome of these investigations or class actions or the date on which
                              they will end.

<p>The parent-company financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors.
                              Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">I. OPINION ON
                              THE PARENT-COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h4>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in
                              France.
                              Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
                              that the parent-company financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
                              audit involves performing procedures, using sample techniques or other selection methods,
                              to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
                              statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
                              used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation
                              of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
                              sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
                              </p>
<p>In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets
                              and
                              liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2016 and
                              of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French
                              accounting principles.
                              </p>
<p>Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to Note 1 to the parent-company
                              financial statements which mentions changes in the method of accounting and presentation
                              of the accounts occurred during the financial year with the first application of Regulation
                              ANC 2015-06 and its impact on the accounting treatment of the merger loss as described
                              in Note 1.3 to the parent-company financial statements.
                              </p>

                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Nature and purpose</h4>
<p>In 1996, Crédit Agricole S.A. signed a tax consolidation agreement with your Company,
                              which was renewed on 22 December 2015 for the 2015-2019 period, for the purpose of
                              establishing the relationship between Crédit Agricole S.A. on the one hand, and your
                              Company and its consolidated subsidiaries on the other, and more particularly the
                              breakdown of the corporate tax charge.
                              </p>
<p>The tax consolidation agreement enabled your Company to benefit from the tax savings
                              achieved by the Crédit Agricole Group in the amount of the individual income tax losses
                              actually deducted by the Group. This agreement was modified on 15 November 2016 in
                              order to account for the expansion of the monetisation, in favour of your Company,
                              of the entirety of the losses of the consolidated sub-group Crédit Agricole CIB deducted
                              by Crédit Agricole S.A. as the head of the tax group, including the tax loss carry-forwards
                              of the sub-group for the years prior to 1 January 2016, already deducted by Crédit
                              Agricole S.A..
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Conditions</h4>
<p>The amount of the compensation to be received in relation to the entire loss of
                              the
                              CACIB sub-group, recognised at 31 December 2016 under the terms of the agreement linking
                              Crédit Agricole S.A. and your Company, is €1,076 million.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Interest of the
                              agreement for the Company</h4>
<p>Your Board of Directors justified this agreement as follows:</p>
<p>the main reason for this modification to the tax consolidation agreement is to
                              expand
                              the monetisation, heretofore limited solely to the individual losses of Crédit Agricole
                              CIB, to the entire consolidated Crédit Agricole CIB sub-group, of which some subsidiaries,
                              being party to boat leasing financing transactions, are faced with the interruption
                              of these financing transactions by lessees prior to their maturity.

                              of Crédit Agricole S.A.; his employment contract will be reinstated under compensation
                              conditions equivalent to the average annual compensation paid to the members of the
                              Executive Committee of Crédit Agricole S.A., excluding corporate officers, during
                              the 12 months preceding the date of termination of his corporate office. In the event
                              of the termination of his position by Crédit Agricole S.A., Mr Brassac shall receive
                              a severance payment under the following conditions and in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF
                              Code.

<p>Should Crédit Agricole S.A. be unable, upon termination of Mr Brassac's office
                              as
                              Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A., to offer him a position equivalent
                              to or comparable with those currently exercised by the members of the Executive Committee
                              of Crédit Agricole S.A., in the form of an offer at least two positions within three
                              months, he shall be eligible, if the termination is at the initiative of Crédit Agricole
                              S.A. and due to a change control or strategy, to a severance payment as follows: The
                              severance payment shall be determined on the basis of twice the total gross annual
                              compensation received for the calendar year preceding the year of termination of Mr
                              Brassac's corporate office. It is agreed that this severance payment shall include
                              any other compensation and, notably, the contractual dismissal compensation due under
                              Mr Brassac's employment contract with Crédit Agricole S.A., the severance payment
                              provided for in Article 10 of his suspended employment contract, any other severance
                              payment due in any form and for any purpose whatsoever, and payment resulting from
                              the application of the noncompetition clause where appropriate.
                              </p>
<p>The payment of the severance compensation, the portion due under his employment
                              contract
                              excepted, is subject to the achievement of the budgetary objectives of the Crédit
                              Agricole Group's business lines in the two years preceding the date of termination
                              of the corporate office, based on the following indicators, which take into account
                              organic growth and the cost of risk:

<p>In any event, it has been agreed between Mr Brassac and Crédit Agricole S.A. that
                              in the event of actual payment of severance compensation, and should he be able at
                              the time of the payment to claim a full pension, that he will not claim his pension
                              before the end of a period of 12 months counted from the date of receipt of the severance
                              payment. Otherwise, Mr Brassac would be required to waive the severance payment;
                              </p>
<p>4. Non-competition clause: Mr Brassac is subject to a non-competition clause that
                              forbids him from accepting employment in France with any company that engages in a
                              business that competes with that of Crédit Agricole S.A.. This commitment is valid
                              for one year from the termination of the employment contract. In exchange, he shall
                              be paid monthly compensation equal to 50% of his last fixed compensation during the
                              period of the undertaking. The accumulation of a severance payment and compensation
                              under the non-competition clause is limited to two years of annual compensation.
                              </p>
<p>The Crédit Agricole S.A. Board of Directors reserves the right to release Mr Brassac
                              from this obligation, in full or in part, when his employment ends.

                              agreement for the Company</h4>
<p>Your Board of Directors justified this agreement as follows:</p>
<p>these undertakings were made in conjunction with Mr Brassac's appointment as Chief
                              Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A. in view of his responsibilities as head
                              of Crédit Agricole S.A. and the Crédit Agricole Group, as well as the specific positioning
                              of the Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A. in respect of the Crédit Agricole
                              Group.
                              </p>
<p>The Board of Directors of Crédit Agricole S.A. authorised the preparation of an
                              employment
                              contract for Mr Philippe Brassac followed by the suspension of this employment contract
                              for the duration of his corporate office as Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole
                              S.A.. The Board considered that maintaining (while suspending) his employment contract
                              would avoid depriving Mr Brassac of rights he had gradually accumulated during his
                              career as an employee in the Crédit Agricole Group (33 years' service), especially
                              in terms of participation in Group plans, taking into account his operational experience
                              as an officer who made a significant contribution to the Group's growth in recent
                              years.
                              </p>
<p>Since these commitments were authorised and approved by the Board and the shareholder's
                              meeting of Crédit Agricole S.A. prior to the publication of Law No 2015-990 of 6 August
                              2015, the provisions of Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
                              commerce) resulting from said law (the annual vesting of supplementary pension entitlements
                              to meeting performance conditions) do not apply.
                              </p>
<p>These commitments were authorised, on an as-needed basis, by the Board of Directors
                              of your Company upon the appointment on 30 July 2015 and the renewal on 9 May 2016

<p>Nature and purpose</p>
<p>To enable your Company to assume the costs resulting from proceedings against all

                              General Meeting of 30 April 2013 in accordance with Article L. 225-42 of the French
                              Commercial Code (Code de commerce), the Board having recused itself insofar as all
                              directors were concerned.

<p>Conditions</p>
<p>In view of the positions held by the directors within the Company, the Board was

                              financial system and implement regulatory and supervision principles to ensure financial
                              stability. It consists of governors, finance ministers and supervisory authorities
                              of the G20 countries. Its primary objective is thus to coordinate the work of national
                              financial authorities and international standards bodies at the international level
                              to regulate and supervise financial institutions. Created at the G20 meeting in London
                              in April 2009, the FSB is the successor of the Financial Stability Forum established
                              in 1999 on G7's initiative.

                              a historical one-year window corresponding to a period of significant financial stress.

<td style="text-align:left;">Transformation risk</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">This risk exists when assets are financed using resources

                              As a result of their traditional business of transforming resources with short maturities
                              into longer term uses, banks are naturally affected by transformation risk, which
                              itself entails liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Transformation is when assets
                              have a longer maturity than liabilities and anti-transformation is when assets are
                              financed by resources with a longer maturity.
