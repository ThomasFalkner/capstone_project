                              THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Dear Stakeholders</h4>
<p>The last seventeen months have been by far the most challenging
                              in the history of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (the "Company"
                              or "Steinhoff N.V.").
                              </p>
<p>As a Management Board our priority through this period has been
                              to re-establish stability for the business by achieving a financial
                              restructuring. This process has been highly complex and demanding
                              but will shortly be complete.
                              </p>
<p>We recognise that we must ensure our Company is never again confronted
                              with a similar incident with respect to controls and governance. To
                              this end, we have developed a Remediation Plan to address the shortcomings
                              that have been identified and ensuring improved standards of compliance,
                              disclosure and professional conduct are adopted throughout the business
                              as we forge our recovery.
                              </p>
<p>We would like to start by expressing our thanks to all of those
                              who have supported the Group during a very difficult time. Many of
                              you have gone through the same feelings of profound shock, anger and
                              disappointment that we in the Group felt as the accounting irregularities
                              were uncovered in December 2017. We are enormously grateful to our
                              shareholders, financiers, customers and suppliers who have stood by
                              us as we have worked through the necessary investigations and audits,
                              and to our employees and others who have worked above and beyond the
                              call of duty.
                              </p>
<p>Our aim as a recently reconstituted Management Board has been to
                              bring stability, leadership and strong governance to a Group that
                              still has very real challenges, but also great strengths in the retail
                              sector, and then to drive its businesses forward to help forge a sustainable
                              recovery.
                              </p>
<p>Of pressing concern has been the financial stability of the Company
                              and the Group. We have been engaged in a tireless effort to restructure
                              our finances since December 2017 and are now entering the final stages
                              of this process. We are grateful to our financial creditors in agreeing
                              to the Lockup Agreement in July 2018, giving us the opportunity to
                              develop a restructuring plan which will, when implemented, give us
                              a period of financial stability to 31 December 2021 as detailed in
                              the Business Review.
                              </p>
<p>The publication today of the delayed Annual Report for 2017, and
                              the restated figures for both 2016 and the opening balance of 2016,
                              is another important milestone for the Group. Preparation of these
                              financial statements has been extremely complex, especially determining
                              the correct IFRS implications of accounting irregularities that cover
                              an extended period and involve a substantial number of entities, both
                              within and outside the Group. This position has been further exacerbated
                              by the fact that certain key individuals, with the requisite knowledge
                              to help unravel these complex transactions, and the consequential
                              effects thereof, have not made themselves available for questioning.
                              This has resulted in an extended investigation, detailed analysis
                              and substantial judgements by the Management Board in arriving at
                              the results for each year and in particular the restatement of the
                              opening balance for 2016.
                              </p>
<p>In arriving at these results, the Management Board has relied on
                              both its own internal investigations and those of the PwC forensic
                              investigation teams to glean the background and facts surrounding
                              the irregularities. In addition, the Company has engaged with both
                              independent technical experts and the Company's External Auditor to
                              determine the most appropriate way to account for the financial effects
                              of the irregularities and the consequential impact thereof. This process
                              included the detailed analyses of the numerous transactions and relationships.
                              These analyses have has in turn been discussed and reviewed by independent
                              technical experts and reviewed and challenged by the Company's External
                              Auditor. The finalisation of the financial statements was dependent
                              on the completion of PwC's forensic investigation, to ensure that
                              all identified issues could be considered and evaluated in the preparation
                              of these financial statements, which in turn enabled completion of
                              the audit by the External Auditor.

<p>Preparation of the Annual Report relating to the 2018 Reporting
                              Period is progressing well and is expected to be published within
                              the next few weeks. As we plan to release the 2018 Annual Report shortly
                              after the 2017 Annual Report, we shall, where it makes sense, duplicate
                              parts of the various reports, including this message and the message
                              from the Supervisory Board. This duplication is aimed at creating
                              a bridge between both publications. Looking at either year in isolation
                              tells only half the story and we believe this approach makes it easier
                              for stakeholders to comprehend the Group's affairs and the surrounding
                              context.
                              </p>
<p>Achievement of this milestone paves the way for us to commence
                              the next phase of our restructuring, which aims to stabilise the Group
                              and maximise the return for all its various stakeholders in a way
                              that enables the long-term growth of the underlying operating entities
                              whilst ensuring the highest standards of corporate governance. As
                              part of the process, we have developed a Remediation Plan.
                              </p>
<p>This Annual Report outlines the events that followed the December
                              2017 announcement of the financial irregularities, and the role of
                              the Management Board in stabilising the Company and the Group. We
                              deal with the events leading up to the December 2017 announcement,
                              focus on the business's performance in the financial years in question,
                              and the financial restructuring process, and then outline our strategy
                              and address the outlook.
                              </p>
<p>At the outset it should be noted that it is now clear from the
                              multiple investigations carried out that the accounting irregularities,
                              over an extended period, masked the fact that the Group's profitability
                              was challenged. As stated above, the investigations identified several
                              areas where the financial results for the previous financial periods
                              required restatement. The detailed restatements are available in the
                              Financial Review of the Annual Report.
                              </p>
<p>For the 12 months to 30 September 2017, the Company's consolidated
                              net sales were €18.8 billion, compared with €16.1 billion for the
                              15 months to 30 September 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The increase in net sales is largely attributable to the first-time
                              inclusion of Mattress Firm in the USA and Poundland in the UK for
                              a full year, both acquired during September 2016. Sales in 2017 were
                              further boosted by the acquisitions of Fantastic in Australia and
                              Tekkie Town in South Africa during the Reporting Period.
                              </p>
<p>The aggressive international expansion of recent years was terminated
                              immediately after the announcement of the accounting irregularities
                              in December 2017.
                              </p>
<p>Due to the level of abnormal transactions impacting each year,
                              the Management Board have chosen to disclose, in addition to the disclosed
                              EBITDA, Sustainable EBITDA that excludes such abnormal transactions
                              (refer to Financial Review section). Sustainable EBITDA was €765 million
                              in 2017 while it was €753 million in 2016 (15 months). In both years
                              operating results were impacted by impairment charges relating to
                              goodwill and other intangible assets, being €3.4 billion in 2017 and
                              €42 million in 2016, impairment charges related to property, plant
                              and equipment of €521 million and €26 million in 2016 and impairment
                              charges relating to other assets of €103 million in 2017 and €161
                              million in 2016.
                              </p>

                              Report.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Stabilising
                              our financial situation
                              </h4>
<p>The Management Board commenced discussions with its financial creditors
                              immediately after the news of the accounting irregularities broke
                              in December 2017. This engagement continued throughout 2018 and in
                              2019 to the date of this Annual Report, at various levels in the Group.
                              The restructuring effort has resulted in the majority of the South
                              African debt being repaid, and funds being raised successfully at
                              operating company level, and culminated in the implementation of the
                              Lock-up Agreement as finally amended, on 20 July 2018. The Lock-Up
                              Agreement was aimed at providing the Group with stability by creating
                              an extended period of time to ensure fair treatment across the various
                              creditor groups, allow management to focus on delivering value at
                              the Group's operating businesses, and achieve a deleveraging of the
                              Group.
                              </p>
<p>The restructuring of the financial indebtedness of Hemisphere,
                              the Group's major European property owning subsidiary, was implemented
                              on 5 September 2018, resulting in a new, secured, three-year term
                              loan facility of approximately €775 million.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">SEAG CVA and
                              SFHG CVA
                              </h4>
<p>On 30 November 2018, SEAG and SFHG, the two subsidiaries where
                              most of the Group's financial creditors are concentrated, launched
                              a debt restructuring through an English Company Voluntary Arrangement
                              ("CVA") process. The SEAG and SFHG CVAs sought to implement the restructuring
                              plan set out in the Lock-Up Agreement. When fully implemented, this
                              will result in the restructuring of the existing financial indebtedness
                              at each of SEAG and SFHG, and will result in the issuance of new private
                              debt by certain newly incorporated subsidiary companies, such debt
                              to mature on 31 December 2021 and to accrue payment-in-kind - (PIK)
                              interest capitalising on a semi-annual basis.
                              </p>
<p>Meetings of the creditors and members of SEAG and SFHG were held
                              on 14 December 2018 at which the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA were approved
                              by the requisite majorities of their respective creditors and by their
                              members. Various conditions have to be satisfied prior to implementation
                              of the restructuring.
                              </p>
<p>On 10 January 2019, an application was issued by a company claiming
                              to be a creditor of SEAG, challenging certain provisions of the CVA
                              proposed in respect of SEAG. Aside from this challenge, no other challenges
                              were received. As the challenge periods have now expired, no further
                              challenges are permitted. On 28 March 2019, the Company and claimant
                              agreed that the challenge application be dismissed on consensual terms.
                              The parties accordingly filed with the court a consent order giving
                              effect to that agreement. This has been approved by the competent
                              court.
                              </p>
<p>On 29 March 2019, the Company announced that the requisite majority
                              of creditors of SEAG and SFHG had provided their consent to the extension
                              of the CVA long-stop date to 31 May 2019. The approval consequently
                              extended the long-stop date as defined in and as applicable to the
                              Lock-Up Agreement to be the same as the extended CVA longstop date.
                              </p>
<p>As a consequence of events that have occurred since the approval
                              of the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA, further amendments and modifications
                              to the SEAG CVA, the SFHG CVA and certain of the associated documents
                              are necessary. Whilst a number of these amendments are minor, technical
                              or administrative in nature, certain of them will require the approval
                              of the certain majorities of relevant creditors. SEAG and SFHG are
                              in the process of finalising the proposed amendments and it is anticipated
                              that SEAG and SFHG will request the relevant consents by way of a
                              separate CVA consent request in due course. It remains the objective
                              of the Group to complete the restructuring as soon as possible.
                              </p>
<p>The Company, SEAG and SFHG have continued to work towards satisfying
                              the remaining conditions detailed in the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA
                              which need to be satisfied prior to the implementation of the restructuring.
                              This has included, among other things, seeking to:

<p>As referred to in the consent request circulated on 15 March 2018
                              and the "Update on progress of the financial restructuring" published
                              on the Steinhoff website on 29 April 2019, SEAG and SFHG consider
                              that certain further amendments and modifications to the SEAG CVA
                              and the SFHG CVA and certain of the associated documents will be necessary.
                              Once the work to update the SEAG CVA, the SFHG CVA and the relevant
                              documents to reflect developments since 28 November 2018 has been
                              completed (including the resolution of certain outstanding points
                              with the SEAG and SFHG creditor groups), it is envisaged that the
                              relevant consents to make such amendments will be requested by SEAG
                              and SFHG by way of a separate CVA consent request.
                              </p>
<p>Provided the relevant consents are received and all remaining conditions
                              to implementation are satisfied, implementation of the restructuring
                              will commence. It remains the objective of the Group to complete the
                              restructuring as soon as possible.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Cash managements</h4>
<p>In addition to the Lock-up Agreement and the CVA process, the Group
                              has instituted tight control over capital expenditure and the management
                              of working capital, with clear focus on receivables, payables and
                              inventories, to help strengthen its cash position.
                              </p>
<p>Our divestment programme has also moved forward at pace. We have
                              announced the sale of several investments during the past year. The
                              full detail of corporate activity during 2016, 2017 and 2018 can be
                              found in the Financial Review section of this Report of the Management
                              Board. In view of what has transpired since December 2017, it is unlikely
                              that the Group will engage in investment activities in the near future.
                              Instead, it is expected that the Group will initiate further divestments
                              to help stabilise the Group and repay financial creditors.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Litigation</h4>
<p>Several legal proceedings have been initiated against the Company
                              and certain of its Subsidiaries during the past seventeen months.
                              A newly constituted litigation committee consisting of the CEO (Louis
                              du Preez), a Supervisory Director (Peter Wakkie) and two nominated
                              Supervisory Directors (Paul Copley and David Pauker), in consultation
                              with the Group's attorneys, continue to assess the merits of and responses
                              to these claims. A number of initial defences have been filed.

                              </h4>
<p>The Group continues to engage with regulators.</p>
<p>Steinhoff was invited to present to the South African Parliament
                              on several occasions during 2018 and 2019 and used these opportunities
                              to update its joint committees on progress made since the announcements
                              in December 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The Company remains in contact with the Company's principal stock-market
                              regulators regarding its listings: the AFM in the Netherlands, the
                              FSE and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (Bundesanstalt
                              fur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) and the JSE in South Africa.
                              </p>
<p>We remain committed to maintaining open communication lines with
                              all our regulators and this forms an integral part of the Group's
                              Remediation Plan going forward
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Our strategic
                              direction
                              </h4>
<p>As stated above, as a new Management Board, we have a clear objective:
                              to stabilise the Company in a way that ensures the longterm stability
                              and growth of its underlying operations, maximises stakeholder returns
                              and protects value, against the backdrop of substantially enhanced
                              standards of corporate governance and control. This objective is at
                              the heart of our Remediation Plan.
                              </p>
<p>In the first instance, we are concentrating on establishing a clear
                              understanding of the true value and potential of each of our businesses,
                              and we will be able to further develop the future strategy of the
                              Company once this process is complete.
                              </p>
<p>We are making fundamental changes across the organisation, placing
                              a renewed focus on the customer, as well as implementing the tighter
                              control of capital mentioned above.
                              </p>
<p>We are also stepping up our efforts to lower our cost base and
                              maintain local market leadership. Simplifying the organisation will
                              assist in this regard. The purpose of our operating businesses remains
                              the delivery of a unique standard of quality to our customers at superior
                              value.
                              </p>
<p>Together, these steps will enable us to establish a new foundation
                              for increasing free cash generation, to reduce the level of debt and
                              over time creating value for our stakeholders.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Trading subsequent
                              to 2017
                              </h4>
<p>In the 2018 and 2019 financial years, we expect that our consolidated
                              net sales will be reduced by the impact of several factors including
                              a number of disposals, a weaker global economy and stronger competition
                              in our markets. These factors have been compounded by the reputational
                              damage associated with the disclosures in December 2017, constraints
                              from supplier credit lines and the related uncertainty associated
                              with the ongoing investigations.
                              </p>
<p>We expect that operating expenses, excluding the impact of currency
                              exchange rates, will be significantly higher than in 2017 due to the
                              substantial increase in adviser costs and professional fees associated
                              with the investigation and restructuring effort, which has been detailed
                              and extensive. We shall therefore experience an adverse impact on
                              our consolidated operating income, before impairments, in both 2018
                              and 2019 financial years.
                              </p>
<p>We also expect net financial expenses, excluding the impact of
                              currency exchange rates, to be higher than in 2017. This will adversely
                              affect net income.
                              </p>
<p>We have restricted our capital expenditures during the 2018 and
                              2019 financial years in order to strengthen our free cash flow. Accordingly,
                              we have delayed or cancelled several planned initiatives that involve
                              discretionary capital expenditures, such as store remodelling. However,
                              we expect to continue working on initiatives that will reduce our
                              administrative costs, as well as other initiatives, including the
                              opening of new stores that are critical for us to remain competitive
                              in our markets. Our objective is to fund these initiatives largely
                              through cash generated by the operations.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Outlook</h4>
<p>The Company and the Group have worked hard to recover from the
                              consequences post the announcement of 5 December 2017. The collective
                              effort made by those within and outside the Group to meet the challenge
                              of a wide-ranging and complex financial restructuring has been impressive
                              to witness. Much has been achieved but we still have a long way to
                              go, including resolving the various legal proceedings that have been
                              initiated against the Company.
                              </p>
<p>With implementation of the financial restructuring nearing completion,
                              we shall once again be able to focus fully on our operating businesses,
                              giving them the support they require to help the Group reestablish
                              value for our stakeholders.
                              </p>
<p>The whole team continues to work tirelessly towards this objective.</p>

<p>The Management Board remains positive about the Company's ability
                              to weather the current situation. All actions being taken, as set
                              out in this Annual Report, are aimed at repositioning the Group as
                              a more resilient business.
                              </p>
<p>We appreciate our financial creditors' support and willingness
                              to explore solutions in the best interests of all stakeholders. We
                              value the ongoing support of our loyal shareholders as we navigate
                              through these difficult times. We also thank all our business partners.
                              </p>
<p>We have new management in place in key positions and close to 120.000

                              </p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, the
                              senior management teams and the Supervisory Board. They have worked

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">MESSAGE FROM
                              THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Dear Stakeholder</h4>
<p>The past year and a half has been the most difficult period in
                              the Company's history. The announcement on 5 December 2017 that the
                              Chief Executive Officer's offer to resign had been accepted, and that
                              the Supervisory Board had appointed Werksmans Attorneys to engage
                              PwC to conduct a forensic investigation into accounting irregularities,
                              marked the start of a period of intense pressure and uncertainty.
                              A detailed account of these events can be found in the Annual Report.
                              </p>
<p>We understand the serious disappointment and concern caused by
                              the Company's problems, and the very real consequences. These have
                              included losses for investors and financial creditors, difficulties
                              for operational managers and uncertainty for staff.
                              </p>
<p>Throughout this period, the Supervisory Board has focused relentlessly
                              on stabilising the Company, the nomination of new Managing Directors
                              and improving effective governance. The Group has cooperated with
                              the investigations of regulators and will continue to do so. The Supervisory
                              Board is determined to ensure that the Company moves forward in the
                              right way, addressing the problems of the past but also builds on
                              its operational strength in retail to achieve a sustainable recovery.
                              </p>
<p>The Management Board has already made substantial progress with
                              a financial restructuring that will bring the stability needed for
                              the Company to focus fully once more on its operating businesses.
                              </p>
<p>The development of the Remediation Plan has also identified areas
                              where controls and procedures can be improved to align them with best
                              practice.
                              </p>
<p>Publication today of this Annual Report is another major milestone
                              in this process.
                              </p>
<p>The new Management Board, as explained in their report, is tackling
                              the challenges it inherited with skill and vigour and we are grateful
                              for the exceptional work in extremely difficult circumstances that
                              were not of its making.
                              </p>
<p>We also want to thank all the Company's stakeholders for their
                              continued support, particularly the shareholders, financial creditors
                              and the Group's close to 120.000 employees across the world. They
                              have worked hard and loyally in the face of great uncertainty and
                              deserve our admiration and gratitude.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Governance
                              &amp; Leadership
                              </h4>
<p>In December 2017, the Supervisory Board intensified its oversight
                              and established a committee composed solely of independent Supervisory
                              Directors to ensure independent oversight was exercised. Rapid action
                              was also taken to strengthen the Management Board with the appointment
                              of new executives to critical roles, and with the designation of Danie
                              van der Merwe as acting Chief Executive Officer on 19 December 2017.
                              Danie's retail and operational experience, and institutional knowledge,
                              were vital in securing the immediate future of the business in the
                              first crucial phase of the Restructuring. Four executives were nominated
                              to the Management Board: Alexandre Nodale as Deputy CEO, Louis du
                              Preez as Commercial Director, Philip Dieperink as Chief Financial
                              Officer and Theodore de Klerk as Chief Operational Officer.
                              </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter a number of Supervisory Directors stepped down
                              and new Supervisory Directors were nominated. The reconstituted Management
                              Board, in close consultation with the reconstituted Supervisory Board,
                              as discussed below, then steered the Group through an intensely difficult
                              period, as the scale of the recovery task became clear.
                              </p>
<p>Most significantly, the Management Board's task included securing
                              a number of new credit facilities to stabilise the Company's financial
                              situation, allowing the vital work on the financial restructuring
                              to commence.
                              </p>
<p>As announced on 19 November 2018, Louis du Preez was subsequently
                              designated Chief Executive Officer, effective from 1 January 2019,
                              following Danie van der Merwe's decision to step down, having met
                              the objectives set when he took on the acting CEO role. Louis has
                              a wealth of commercial and corporate experience and is well-placed
                              to lead the Company through the Restructuring and into the next phase
                              of its recovery. We thank Danie for his extensive contribution to
                              the Group over many years and for leading it through an exceptionally
                              challenging period.
                              </p>
<p>On 11 April 2019, the Company announced that Alexandre Nodale had
                              stepped down as deputy CEO and as a member of the Management Board.
                              We thank Alexandre for his service to the Group - he has been a valued
                              member of the Management Board and we wish him every success in his
                              future endeavours.
                              </p>
<p>We have full confidence in the Management Board's approach, and
                              with the strong, committed and talented team in place.
                              </p>

                              Management Board can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Forensic investigation</h4>
<p>In December 2017, Werksmans Attorneys appointed PwC to conduct
                              an independent forensic investigation. The task was substantial, complex
                              and time-consuming and involved interaction with Deloitte, the Company's
                              External Auditor; third parties; regulators; special purpose vehicles;
                              entities outside the Group; and current and former Supervisory and
                              Managing Directors, senior managers and employees. The investigations
                              continued throughout 2018 with regular feedback to a committee of
                              the Supervisory Board, consisting of several newly appointed Supervisory
                              Directors (Peter Wakkie, Moira Moses and Alex Watson), and Louis du
                              Preez. This committee was charged with oversight of the investigation.
                              As announced on 15 March 2019, PwC has completed its report, the impact
                              on the financial statements has been assessed and taken into account
                              and the broader implications of the findings are being considered.
                              </p>
<p>For further information about this investigation is included in
                              the Report of the Management Board.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Annual Report</h4>
<p>While the thoroughness of the investigations and subsequent audit
                              resulted in several unavoidable delays to the completion of this Annual
                              Report, publication today addresses one of the most significant outstanding
                              tasks arising from the December 2017 disclosures. The 2018 Annual
                              Report is progressing well, and we expect that the report will be
                              published within the next few weeks.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Outlook</h4>
<p>The journey to restore the Company's reputation will be a long
                              one and, as we pursue this aim, we understand that we will remain
                              under intense scrutiny. However, very real progress has already been
                              made. The completion of the forensic investigation, the restatement
                              of the 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements and the publication
                              of this Annual Report are all important milestones, and the extreme
                              care taken in their preparation can help us all face the future with
                              confidence.
                              </p>
<p>As the Company moves forward with new leadership in the Management
                              Board and oversight by the Supervisory Board, with a commitment to
                              strengthen corporate governance and internal controls, with a clear
                              Remediation Plan that addresses the issues identified by the forensic
                              report in place, and with a period of financial stability afforded
                              by the financial restructuring, we are confident that we are on the
                              path to recovery and re-emergence as a robust company with strong,
                              long-term prospects.
                              </p>

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Announcement
                              of accounting irregularities and appointment of PwC forensic team
                              </h4>
<p>The revelation of accounting irregularities and the resignation
                              of the former CEO on 5 December 2017 had a profound impact on the
                              Group. Deloitte recommended that an independent forensic investigation
                              be conducted into the irregularities. Following concerns raised by
                              the Company's External Auditor, Deloitte, over potential accounting
                              irregularities, which prompted Deloitte to request that an independent
                              forensic investigation be performed, PwC was appointed b Werksmans
                              Attorneys. It was clear that the Company's 2016 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements would require restatement and they were withdrawn. A decision
                              was made to delay the publication of the 2017 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements.
                              </p>
<p>Immediate changes were made to strengthen the independent governance
                              of the Group, including the appointment of an independent sub-committee
                              of the Supervisory Board.

<p>Factors including the withdrawal of undrawn facilities, closure
                              of bank accounts, termination of the cash pooling arrangements between

                              combined effect of creating enormous liquidity constraints within
                              the Group. The various announcements and press coverage together with
                              the inability to produce audited accounts at entity level, because
                              of the ongoing investigation, resulted in additional supplier and
                              credit insurance pressure on the Group's operating companies.
                              </p>
<p>In response, the Group engaged with its lenders, bondholders and
                              other financial creditors, including by way of presentations to lenders
                              and credit insurers in London and South Africa during December 2017
                              and January 2018.

<p>The Company appointed Danie van der Merwe as interim CEO. It then
                              strengthened the Management Board with several appointments including
                              those of Louis du Preez (Commercial Director), Philip Dieperink (Chief
                              Financial Officer), Theodore de Klerk (Operational Director) and Alexandre
                              Nodale (Deputy CEO).
                              </p>
<p>The Company announced the appointment of Richard Heis as Chief
                              Restructuring Officer on 15 February 2018.
                              </p>
<p>Other immediate actions included the sale of certain non-core investments
                              such as the Group's sale of portion of its stake in its associate,
                              PSG, from 25.5% to 16.0%, yielding proceeds of approximately ZAR4.7
                              billion to help fund operations on 15 December 2017. The Group sold
                              its remaining PSG stake raising a further ZAR7.7 billion during January
                              2018.
                              </p>
<p>Short-term liquidity was further supported by a series of non-core
                              European asset disposals such as the sale of the Group's ordinary
                              shares in Atterbury Europe on 18 December 2017 (€20 million) and of
                              the Mariahilferstrasse property in Vienna on 29 December 2017 (€70
                              million). The Group's non-voting participating preference shares in
                              Atterbury Europe were sold in June 2018 for €223.5 million.
                              </p>
<p>Progress was also made in raising finance at the Group's operational
                              levels:
                              </p>
<p>(i) Mattress Firm raised USD150 million to fund working capital
                              and operational requirements in December 2017 and January 2018;
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Pepkor Europe obtained a new credit facility of GBP264 million
                              to finance working capital and operational requirements on 3 January
                              2018;
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Conforama agreed on 11 January 2018 to sell its 17% stake
                              in SRP for approximately €79 million to raise further liquidity for
                              the business. On 24 January 2018, Conforama agreed funding from Tikehau
                              Capital of €115 million for three years and a separate €28 million
                              facility.
                              </p>
<p>New procedures were instituted to rigorously control cash management
                              across the Group.
                              </p>
<p>On 31 January 2018, the Company provided a progress update to the
                              South African Parliament.
                              </p>
<p>In February co-ordinating committee of lenders was established

                              </h4>
<p>On 9 March 2018, following the settlement of all notes (with a
                              principal value of approximately ZAR7.6 billion) issued under the
                              Domestic Medium-Term Note programme, the Group announced the deregistration
                              of the programme. This programme had been issued by Steinhoff Services,
                              a financing Subsidiary of the Group.
                              </p>
<p>On 13 March 2018, the Group raised €251 million by way of a placing
                              of KAP shares. This reduced the Group's interest in KAP, from c. 43%
                              to c. 26%.
                              </p>
<p>Given that many of the Group's European finance companies and international
                              operating companies required ongoing funding, and to avoid continued
                              reliance on asset disposals, extensive negotiations were commenced
                              with key creditor groups to formulate a viable restructuring plan.
                              </p>
<p>On 3 April 2018, Hemisphere, the Group's European property Subsidiary,
                              announced a valuation for its real estate portfolio of €1.1 billion,
                              on the basis of fair value under IFRS assuming vacant possession.
                              This was significantly lower than the book value previously disclosed
                              (€2.2 billion).
                              </p>
<p>At the time, discussions had already commenced with the Group's
                              financial creditors with a view to ensuring longterm financial stability
                              as well as resolving short-term cash flow difficulties. Extensive
                              negotiations around the restructuring continued against this backdrop.
                              </p>
<p>Since the December 2017 announcement, the financial creditors of
                              the Company, its subsidiaries SFHG and SEAG (which at that point held
                              the primary debt obligations of the Group), Hemisphere, Pepkor (previously
                              STAR) and SUSHI, had provided support to the Group by:
                              </p>
<p>(i) not taking any action against the Company, SEAG, SFHG, Hemisphere,
                              Pepkor, or SUSHI based on any actual or potential defaults arising
                              under the relevant finance documents;
                              </p>
<p>(ii) where relevant, agreeing to rollovers of facilities; and</p>
<p>(iii) where applicable, confirming they would not seek immediate
                              repayment of matured facilities.
                              </p>
<p>On 12 April 2018, the Group announced the successful placement
                              of 200 million ordinary shares in Pepkor through an accelerated bookbuild.
                              This raised c. €254 million and reducing the Group's interest in Pepkor
                              from 77% to 71%.
                              </p>
<p>On 20 April 2018, the Company held its annual General Meeting in
                              Amsterdam (with a video link to Cape Town). It provided a detailed
                              update presentation which was followed by a question and answer session
                              for shareholders. Shareholders appointed the new Supervisory Directors
                              and Managing Directors.
                              </p>
<p>On 18 May 2018, the Company gave a lender presentation outlining
                              a proposed restructuring framework. The Management Board and their
                              advisors subsequently entered into extensive negotiations with the
                              financial creditors with a view to implementing a restructuring plan
                              agreeable to the financial creditor group. The Company also provided
                              guidance on the Group's halfyear performance.
                              </p>
<p>On 23 May 2018 it was announced that Pepkor had successfully completed
                              the refinancing of the Shareholder funding provided by the Group.
                              This facilitated the repayment of the Group's remaining South African
                              debt. Since January 2018 the Group had repaid approximately €2 billion
                              of African debt owed directly by it, and the Pepkor repayment left
                              it with no remaining African debt other than that within the working
                              capital facilities of the Automotive business and the African properties
                              division. The Pepkor debt had been successfully placed at operational
                              level.

                              </h4>
<p>During June to August 2018 the Management Board and the financial
                              creditors negotiated the terms of a Lock-Up Agreement. This Lock-Up-Agreement
                              was designed to, among other things, provide stability by creating
                              an extended period to ensure fair treatment across the various financial
                              creditor groups, allow management to focus on delivering value at
                              the Group's operating businesses, and achieve a deleveraging of the
                              Group and a detailed assessment of all contingent litigation claims.
                              Whilst negotiations were ongoing around the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement,
                              SEAG and SFHG agreed the terms of certain creditor support letters
                              which became effective on 7 June 2018 and were amended on 29 June
                              2018. Under these support letters, the relevant creditors agreed to
                              provide SEAG and SFHG with a number of temporary support measures
                              to facilitate discussions in connection with a potential restructuring
                              plan and the Lock-Up Agreement. These support measures included commitments
                              on behalf of creditors not to petition for any action that would cause
                              SEAG or SFHG to enter into insolvency proceedings, prematurely declare
                              due and payable or otherwise seek to accelerate payment of all or
                              any part of any debt, bring legal proceedings against any member of
                              the Group or enforce any rights under any guarantee or any right in
                              respect of any security.

<p>As consideration for creditors entering into support letters, SEAG
                              and SFHG agreed to abide by various undertakings during the period
                              for which the letters were in place. These restrictions included restrictions
                              on incurring additional indebtedness, restrictions on granting security
                              and taking certain other actions without the prior consent of the
                              relevant parties.

                              had been concluded. The loss-making operating companies were sold
                              for a nominal consideration, whilst the consideration for the property
                              holding companies was based on an enterprise value of approximately
                              €490 million (subject to certain adjustments). The decision to sell
                              was motivated by the withdrawal of kika-Leiner's credit insurance
                              cover which created significant liquidity constraints and would have
                              placed significant further cash demands on the Group given that the
                              kika-Leiner businesses were both loss making and required significant
                              future investment to implement a turnaround plan. The disposal of

                              Lock-Up Agreement was ultimately acceded to by creditors representing
                              approximately 97% of SEAG debt and 98% of SFHG debt. The support letters
                              terminated with effect from the effective date of the Lock-Up Agreement.
                              </p>
<p>The key terms of the Lock-Up Agreement included financial creditors
                              agreeing that the indebtedness owed to them would be subject to limited
                              recourse terms, the parties agreeing to support and implement the
                              restructuring in accordance with the term sheet and steps plan, and
                              no financial creditor being entitled to take enforcement action in
                              respect of any of the relevant financial indebtedness. The LockUp
                              Agreement also prohibited the assignment of any voting rights or interests
                              in any such financial indebtedness without the transferee acceding
                              to the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement. It also required each financial
                              creditor to consent to the roll-over or extension of the maturity
                              date in respect of any financial indebtedness falling due whilst the
                              Lock-Up Agreement was effective.

                              </h4>
<p>Scheme On 5 October 2018, the Group announced that Mattress Firm
                              had filed voluntary Chapter 11 cases in the United States Bankruptcy
                              Court. This process allowed Mattress Firm to implement a financial
                              restructuring through a court-supervised process while continuing
                              to trade as normal. The Chapter 11 process was conducted for two primary
                              reasons, to allow Mattress Firm to secure additional funding and restructure
                              its balance sheet, and to enable it to rightsize its retail store
                              portfolio.
                              </p>
<p>On 16 November 2018, the Chapter 11 Plan was approved by the United
                              States Bankruptcy Court and, following satisfaction of certain conditions,
                              the Mattress Firm entities emerged from Chapter 11 having successfully
                              completed a reorganisation. In accordance with the Chapter 11 plan,
                              Mattress Firm emerged with access to USD525 million in exit financing
                              and successfully exited approximately 640 underperforming stores.
                              </p>
<p>On 21 November 2018, in consideration for providing the financing
                              required by the Mattress Firm entities in order to exit Chapter 11,
                              the lenders providing the exit financing, received 49.9% of the shares
                              in SUSHI. The Group retains the remaining 50.1% of the shares in SUSHI.
                              Both the lenders' and the Group's shareholding are subject to dilution
                              by a management incentive plan.
                              </p>
<p>On 10 October 2018, shortly after the Mattress Firm entities filed
                              for relief under Chapter 11, SUSHI launched an English scheme of arrangement
                              in respect of its USD200 million revolving credit facility. The SUSHI
                              Scheme became effective on 16 November 2018. Under the SUSHI Scheme,
                              the lenders under the existing SUSHI revolving credit facility exchanged
                              their rights under that facility for substantially similar rights

                              The Company released an overview of the forensic investigation, via
                              the Company's website. On the same date. PwC has been requested to
                              undertake a further phase of investigative work (phase II) in respect
                              of certain issues identified that the Supervisory Board and Management
                              Board believe will not be material to the Company's financial statements
                              but which may be significant for other reasons and therefore require
                              further investigation, conclusion and resolution.

                              </h4>
<p>On 11 April 2019, the French Commercial Court of Meaux approved
                              a conciliation agreement entered into between Conforama and its creditors,
                              as part of a French law conciliation process which provided the framework
                              for the refinancing negotiations. This ruling allowed Conforama to
                              proceed to implement its financial restructuring.
                              </p>
<p>The key terms of the financial restructuring included a total nominal
                              value of €316 million new money financing (including undrawn and conditional
                              commitments) and a warrant in favour of the funders over 49.9% of
                              the shares in Conforama. Funds were available from 15 April 2019.
                              </p>
<p>Alexandre Nodale stepped down as CEO of Conforama and deputy CEO
                              and member of the Management Board following this ruling.

<p>The Company, SEAG and SFHG have continued to work towards satisfying
                              the remaining conditions detailed in the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA,
                              which need to be satisfied prior to the implementation of the restructuring.
                              This has included, among other things, seeking to:
                              </p>
<p>(i) finalise the tax structure paper in relation to the restructuring;</p>
<p>(ii) obtain relevant tax clearances;</p>
<p>(iii) clarify the methodology for calculating creditor entitlements

                              certain underlying data with relevant creditors;
                              </p>
<p>(iv) progress, and where possible satisfy, certain of the conditions
                              precedent detailed in the relevant documents; and
                              </p>
<p>(v) update the SEAG CVA, SFHG CVA and certain of the associated
                              documents to reflect developments since 28 November 2018, in consultation
                              with the SEAG and SFHG creditor groups (and their advisers).
                              </p>
<p>As referred to in the consent request on 20 March 2018 and the
                              "Update on progress of the financial restructuring" published on the
                              Company's website on 29 April 2019, SEAG and SFHG consider that certain
                              further amendments and modifications to the SEAG CVA and the SFHG
                              CVA and certain of the associated documents will be necessary.
                              </p>
<p>Once the work to update the SEAG CVA, the SFHG CVA and the relevant
                              documents to reflect developments since 28 November 2018 has been
                              completed (including the resolution of certain outstanding points
                              with the SEAG and SFHG creditor groups), it is envisaged that the
                              relevant consents to make such amendments will be requested by SEAG
                              and SFHG by way of a separate CVA consent request.
                              </p>
<p>Provided that the relevant consents are received and all remaining
                              conditions to implementation are satisfied, implementation of the
                              restructuring will commence. It remains the objective of the Group
                              to complete the restructuring as soon as possible.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Background</h4>
<p>The last 17 months have been a challenging time for the Company,
                              its Subsidiaries, employees and stakeholders. The discovery of accounting
                              irregularities, the sudden resignation of the CEO in December 2017,
                              other changes to the senior leadership team and the Supervisory Board,
                              the material decline in the share price, and the withdrawal of various
                              credit and trade facilities, have all had a profound impact on the
                              Company, the Group and its stakeholders. The Group has subsequently
                              been engaged in a complex restructuring that has encompassed all aspects
                              of its business.
                              </p>
<p>The Management Board has focused on re-establishing stability within
                              the Group's operations, negotiating, agreeing and implementing the
                              restructuring plan with the Group's financial creditors, improving
                              governance at all levels, and finalising the audited financial results
                              for the reporting periods.
                              </p>
<p>Stakeholders have been kept informed by regular announcements released
                              through formal channels. All announcements can be found on the Investor
                              Relations website of the Company: www.steinhoffinternational.com/sens.php.
                              </p>
<p>The scope and timing of the investigation, the fact that the accounting
                              irregularities appear to cover an extended period, the complexity
                              associated with determining the appropriate accounting treatment to
                              be afforded the requisite adjustments and the scale of the restructuring
                              has meant a delay in the publication of the Annual Report for both
                              2017 and 2018 was unavoidable. Following the delay, this Annual Report
                              is prepared for the financial year ended on 30 September 2017, the
                              Reporting Date.
                              </p>
<p>The preparation of the Annual Report for the 2018 Reporting Period
                              is progressing well, and the Management Board is expecting to publish
                              these financial statments within the next few weeks. As the Annual
                              Report for the 2018 Reporting Period will be published shortly after
                              this Annual Report, where it makes sense, portions of this Annual
                              Report will be replicated in the Annual Report for the 2018 Reporting
                              Period. This duplication is aimed at ensuring there is a bridge between
                              both Annual Reports. As stated previously, looking at either year
                              in isolation tells only half the story. The Management Board believes
                              this approach allows stakeholders to comprehend the Company and Group's
                              affairs and the surrounding context.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Financial
                              reporting and restatement process
                              </h4>
<p>The preparation of the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements has
                              been extremely complex. Determining the correct IFRS implications
                              of the accounting irregularities that cover an extended period and
                              involve a substantial number of entities, both within and outside
                              the Group, has been specifically challenging.
                              </p>
<p>This position has been further exacerbated by the fact that certain
                              key individuals, with the requisite knowledge to help unravel these
                              complex transactions, and the consequential effects thereof, have
                              not made themselves available for questioning or have only made themselves
                              available for limited questioning. This has resulted in an extended
                              investigation, detailed analysis and substantial judgements having
                              to be made by the Management Board in arriving at the results for
                              each year and the restatement of the opening balance for 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The consequential impact of reversing the accounting irregularities
                              is the fact that the restatements highlight that several of the group's
                              operating entities are unprofitable as can be seen in the restated
                              segmental report. This has had a material impact on a number of areas
                              including the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
                              </p>
<p>In arriving at these results, the Management Board has relied on
                              both our internal and the PwC forensic investigations to glean the
                              background and facts surrounding the irregularities.
                              </p>
<p>The Management Board's approach to financial reporting and the
                              restatement process, following the findings of the various investigations
                              undertaken, has been to assimilate and analyse as much information
                              as possible to place management in a position to determine the likely
                              financial impact of all transactions under investigation. In preparing
                              the financial statements, the Management Board has, as set out in
                              the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements, considered and applied
                              a significant number of judgements, especially in circumstances where
                              the information was incomplete.
                              </p>
<p>A detailed analysis has been made, covering numerous transactions
                              and relationships with each area requiring judgement in order to arrive
                              at the best and most appropriate accounting treatment. This analysis
                              has been widely debated and reviewed by the accounting teams within
                              the Group as well as by PwC's technical team as external advisers.
                              In addition, the Audit and Risk Committee appointed a sub-committee,
                              headed by Alex Watson, to review and debate the analysis and conclusions
                              reached. Once finalised, the analysis was assessed as part of the
                              audit procedures by Deloitte. This has resulted in a very thorough,
                              but time-consuming, process.
                              </p>
<p>Throughout the process, weekly meetings have been held between
                              the financial teams, members of the subcommittee, PwC technical and
                              forensic teams and the External Auditor to agree plans, discuss progress
                              made and ensure that communication channels remained open and clear.
                              </p>
<p>Regular feedback has been provided to the Audit and Risk Committee,
                              with a specific feedback meeting in mid-April 2019 to discuss and
                              challenge all judgements made, estimates applied, and conclusions
                              reached in this regard. The External Auditor, including its forensic
                              partners, attended this meeting.
                              </p>
<p>The finalisation of the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements
                              was dependent on the completion of PwC's forensic investigation, to
                              ensure that all identified issues could be considered and evaluated
                              in the preparation of these financial statements, which in turn enabled
                              completion of the audit by the External Auditor.
                              </p>
<p>The process to determine substantive control over various previous
                              transactions identified as being not at arm's length has been completed.
                              The Management Board has requested repayment of affected loan assets
                              granted in respect of transactions that may not have been on arm's
                              length terms and/or rates and has also requested financial information
                              from the parties involved. Notwithstanding requests for information,
                              at the date of this Annual Report, the Management Board has been unable
                              to obtain detailed financial information on certain structures, therefore
                              making the assessment of any loan recoverability, or the possible
                              impact of consolidating such structures, not possible at this stage.
                              </p>
<p>In respect of property valuations, the Management Board considered
                              the impairments identified by the fair value analysis. A decision
                              was made by the Management Board to recognise the majority of impairments
                              identified by these valuations in the 2017 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements, as formal third party valuations were not obtained for
                              earlier years. It is likely that the impairments should have also
                              impacted earlier years. The removal of step-ups created through nonarm's
                              length sale and buy-back transactions were however processed in the
                              correct financial year. The Group also revisited its depreciation
                              estimates and applied these estimates to the revised property values.
                              </p>
<p>The various restatements led to the forecast information used in
                              goodwill and brand impairment models having to be revised. The Management
                              Board has also revised the WACC rates in line with the risk profile
                              and revised size of the Group. The impairments of goodwill and brands
                              are substantial. The Management Board has felt it appropriate in the
                              circumstances to roll back the impairment testing to earlier years.
                              The majority of the impairments relate to prior periods, with the
                              exception of Mattress Firm which was impaired at the end of September
                              2017. As the impairment models are sensitive to any adjustment to
                              forecast or WACC rate inputs, any new information may lead to further
                              adjustments (note 8.1 to the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements).
                              </p>
<p>Other than as mentioned in note 21.3 of the 2017 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements, none of the vendor or shareholders claims have been provided
                              for. The Management Board, in consultation with its legal advisors,
                              is in the process of assessing the quantum and validity of all claims
                              received to date, and any potential settlement values. As the amount
                              and timing of most possible settlements could not be measured with
                              sufficient reliability at the date of this Annual Report, very few
                              provisions are recognised. Please refer to the contingent liabilities
                              note in the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements (note 22.3 to the
                              2017 Consolidated Financial Statements) and to the legal claims provision
                              (note 21.3 of the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements).
                              </p>
<p>The tax impact of the restatements remains uncertain. For the purpose
                              of these results the Management Board estimated the impact of any
                              tax corrections arising from the restatements and reversed deferred
                              tax liabilities relating to brands that were impaired. In a number
                              of cases the restatement will result in the reversal of income which
                              will result in subsidiaries being placed in loss-making positions,
                              which could impact on the recognition of deferred tax assets. Where
                              apparent, these deferred asset balances have been reversed. A comprehensive
                              tax review is currently being undertaken, which will take time, considering
                              the multi-jurisdictional nature of the issues involved. and could
                              result in further restatements. At this stage, the Management Board
                              is unable to conclude with certainty on the tax impact of the restatements.
                              The External Auditor has expressed similar concerns.

                              financial statement relating to Steinhoff N.V.
                              </h4>
<p>The Company's financial statements, reflecting the Company as a
                              separate investment holding company, are included after the 2017 Consolidate
                              Financial Statements. Investment holding company stand-alone financial
                              statements are often confusing in nature as the operational transactions
                              take place within the Subsidiary companies and all that is reflected
                              in the holding company financial statements are the transactions typically
                              associated with a listed holding company (investment in subsidiaries,
                              acquisitions and disposals, dividend and interest income, foreign
                              exchange gains or losses, management fees and profit or loss on disposal
                              of investments).
                              </p>
<p>The 2017 and comparative 2016 holding company financial statements
                              have been further distorted initially by the increase in corporate
                              activity and group re-organisations during the year, followed by the
                              accounting impacts flowing from the discovery of accounting irregularities
                              and questionable transactions, together with the realisation that
                              certain operations were not as profitable as previously thought. These
                              impacts include:
                              </p>
<p>(i) Various restatements to correct prior period errors relating
                              to initial recognition and valuation of investments in subsidiaries,
                              affecting the 2016 comparatives in the financial statements;
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Recognition of financial guarantees;</p>
<p>(iii) Adjustments to share based payment schemes;</p>

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">External audit</h4>
<p>The 2017 Annual Financial Statements have been audited by the External
                              Auditor, Deloitte, and their opinion is set out in the 2017 Annual
                              Consolidated Financial Statements.
                              </p>
<p>Given the specific circumstances that the Company has been involved
                              in, we as the Management Board were faced with significant and multiple
                              uncertainties, which have been described in our notes on Critical
                              Accounting Estimates and Judgments set out in note 1 of the 2017 Consolidated
                              Financial Statements.
                              </p>
<p>Under International Auditing Standards the auditor shall disclaim
                              an opinion when the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate
                              audit evidence on which to base their opinion, and the auditor concludes
                              that the possible effects on the financial statements of undetected
                              misstatements, if any, could be both material and pervasive or the
                              auditor shall disclaim an opinion when, in extremely rare circumstances
                              involving multiple uncertainties, the auditor concludes that, notwithstanding
                              having obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding each
                              of the individual uncertainties, it is not possible to form an opinion
                              on the financial statements due to the potential interaction of the
                              uncertainties and their possible cumulative effect on the financial
                              statements.
                              </p>
<p>These significant uncertainties resulted in a 'disclaimer of opinion'
                              from the External Auditor. In its auditor's report Deloitte has described
                              the reasons why it has come to that conclusion and it is clear that
                              the Company finds itself in the extremely rare circumstance described
                              above, namely that because of multiple uncertainties, Deloitte cannot
                              form an opinion on the Financial Statements due to the potential interaction
                              of the uncertainties and their cumulative effect on the 2017 Consolidated
                              Financial Statements.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Introduction</h4>
<p>The announcement by the Company on 5 December 2017 and the subsequent
                              announcement that the 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements could
                              no longer be relied on and needed to be restated, as well as the postponement
                              of the publication of the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements,
                              resulted in a significant decline in the Company's share price and
                              serious liquidity constraints across the Group.
                              </p>
<p>The Group took a number of actions to address the liquidity constraints
                              with the aim of restoring stability to its operations, including those
                              detailed below.
                              </p>
<p>Shortly following these announcements, Moelis &amp; Company were
                              appointed as independent financial advisor to support and counsel
                              the Group on the lender discussions. AlixPartners were appointed as
                              operational advisor to assist the Group on liquidity management and
                              operational measures. Linklaters LLP, an international legal adviser,
                              was appointed to advise on restructuring and legal matters.

                              funding
                              </h4>
<p>The events of December 2017 resulted in undrawn facilities at Steinhoff
                              central treasury being cancelled with immediate effect. This limited
                              the ability of the Group to run a central treasury operation and fund
                              its operational businesses. These events also undermined the confidence
                              of the Group's suppliers, customers, and credit insurers (providing
                              credit insurance cover to suppliers). Together this tightening of
                              credit severely affected the ability of all operational businesses
                              to access normal credit facilities and substantially reduced the availability
                              of trade credit. The Group's operations and people were inevitably
                              affected by these factors.
                              </p>
<p>The situation was exacerbated by certain of the Group's operations
                              being faced with a more difficult retail trading environment. This
                              is covered in more detail in the Operational Review
                              </p>
<p>As a consequence of the curtailment of access to Group treasury
                              and the constraints on the Group's banking facilities and other credit
                              lines, the Group's operating subsidiaries were encouraged to and did
                              arrange their own working capital facilities at an operating company
                              level. This enabled them to continue operating independently from
                              their holding companies.
                              </p>
<p>Notwithstanding these challenges the Group successfully repaid
                              approximately €2 billion of South African debt, using proceeds from
                              the sale of the Group's holdings in PSG (25.5%), KAP (17%) and Pepkor
                              (previously known as STAR) (6%), and €1 billion received from Pepkor
                              (Pepkor repaid its intra-group loan during the 2018 financial year
                              after successfully raising its own funding independent from Steinhoff).
                              Save for the Pepkor debt, the working capital facilities of the automotive
                              business, and the African property division, the Group has no remaining
                              African debt.
                              </p>
<p>The Group's European finance companies short-term liquidity has
                              been supported by inter alia, a release of funds from the Group's
                              South African operations and through a series of disposals of non-core
                              European assets.
                              </p>
<p>However, the Group's liquidity position remained challenged due
                              to its overborrowed position. The Group continued to face ongoing
                              funding requirements at many of its European finance companies and
                              international operating companies. As a result, and with a view to
                              ensuring long-term financial stability, the Group engaged with its
                              various financial creditor groups in Europe to develop a restructuring
                              plan to address its current financial position

                              </h4>
<p>At the Group's lender presentation on 18 May 2018, it outlined
                              a proposed framework for the restructuring. It subsequently entered
                              into extensive negotiations with its European financial creditors
                              with a view to implementing the restructuring on terms agreeable to
                              the parties.
                              </p>
<p>Whilst negotiations on the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement were
                              ongoing, the directors of SEAG and SFHG (as Austrian incorporated
                              companies) required further assurances from financial creditors during
                              the interim period prior to the conclusion of such negotiations. As
                              a consequence, each of SEAG and SFHG agreed the terms of support letters
                              which became effective on 7 June 2018 and 29 June 2018. Reference
                              is made to earlier announcements concerning the entry into these formal
                              letters of support.

<p>As announced on 20 July 2018, the Group received support from the
                              requisite majorities of creditor groups to conclude the Lock-Up Agreement
                              which became effective on that day. The Lock-Up Agreement appended
                              a term sheet which detailed the terms of the proposed restructuring
                              and an implementation steps plan.

                              outlined in the Company's presentation to creditors on 18 May 2018
                              and seeks to:
                              </p>
<p>(i) ensure fair treatment across the various financial creditor
                              groups having regard to their existing rights and claims; and
                              </p>
<p>(ii) provide stability to the Group and its stakeholders by affording

                              is the entity with respect to which nomination rights are created
                              for the creditors within the SEAG Group.
                              </p>
<p>The nomination rights of the creditors of the SEAG Group are replicated
                              for these creditors in a number of subsidiaries of Steenbok Newco

                              3 Limited are for up to 4 out of the 6 board members at the initiative
                              of the respective creditors and in consultation with the Company.
                              The Company retains the right to object to nominations. If the Company
                              objects to a nomination made, the creditors have the right to make
                              a new nomination. Further, the Company has the right to dismiss nominees

                              refinancing
                              </h4>
<p>The refinancing of certain financial indebtedness of Greenlit Brands
                              Proprietary Limited (formerly Steinhoff Asia Pacific Group Holdings
                              Proprietary Limited) was implemented on 27 September 2018. This refinancing
                              involved a new senior revolving credit facility and bilateral facilities
                              of AUD256 million for Greenlit Brands Proprietary Limited from Australian
                              banks, providing facilities for Greenlit Brands Proprietary Limited
                              and its subsidiaries through to maturity in October 2020. In addition,
                              as part of the refinancing, existing intercompany debt from certain
                              members of the SEAG group to Greenlit Brands Proprietary Limited and
                              certain of its subsidiaries was refinanced. This intercompany debt,
                              which was previously unsecured, was granted the benefit of security,
                              with a portion of the debt (approx. AUD97 million) sharing security
                              with the Australian banks (albeit on a second-ranking basis). The
                              other portion of the debt (approx. AUD227.5 million) was granted a
                              separate but identical security package and was third ranking. As
                              part of the intercompany refinancing, the maturities for the intercompany
                              debt was extended so that it matured after Australian banks' debt.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, as a number of the Greenlit Brands Proprietary Limited
                              group's retail brands are licensed from SEAG group entities, the refinancing
                              also involved amendments to these intellectual property licences to
                              ensure the relevant Greenlit Brands Proprietary Limited subsidiaries
                              have medium to long-term licensing arrangements in place.

                              financial restructuring
                              </h4>
<p>In addition to the local financings and the South African refinancing
                              referred to in "operational funding" above, a number of steps have
                              been taken in relation to certain sub-groups of the Group that fall
                              outside the scope of the restructuring plan detailed in the Lock-Up
                              Agreement.
                              </p>
<p>On 5 October 2018, the Company announced that its Mattress Firm
                              subsidiaries filed voluntary Chapter 11 cases in the United States
                              Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The filing implemented
                              a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganisation that, inter alia,
                              provided Mattress Firm with access to new financing to support its
                              business and established an efficient and orderly process for closing
                              certain underperforming store locations in the United States. Mattress
                              Firm emerged from Chapter 11 on 21 November 2018, having successfully
                              exited approximately 640 underperforming stores.
                              </p>
<p>In anticipation of Mattress Firm filing, Mattress Firm had access
                              to approximately USD250 million in debtor-in-possession financing
                              to support its ongoing operations during the Chapter 11 cases. On
                              emergence from Chapter 11, Mattress Firm had access to a four-year
                              exit facility term loan in the original principal amount of USD400
                              million, a portion of which was used to repay the debtor-in-possession
                              facilities, and an undrawn exit asset backed lending facility in the
                              amount of USD125 million. In accordance with the terms of the exit
                              facilities, the exit facility lenders received their pro rata share
                              of 49.9% of the equity in SUSHI the owner of Mattress Firm. The Group
                              retaining a 50.1% equity interest in SUSHI. These shareholdings are
                              however in each case subject to dilution by a management incentive
                              plan. On 5 October 2018, as part of the reorganization, SUSHI shares
                              were contributed to SEAG from the Company. The Mattress Firm sub-group
                              was moved within the Group structure from directly below the Company
                              to become a subsidiary of SEAG. This move facilitated the restructuring
                              of certain material intercompany loans owed by SUSHI and the Mattress
                              Firm Group.
                              </p>
<p>In relation to their equity stake, the exit facility lenders and
                              the Group executed a stockholders' agreement that governs, among other
                              things, shareholder rights in relation to the governance of SUSHI
                              and sales of their respective equity interests. The exit facility
                              lenders also receive a USD150 million payment-in-kind facility that
                              has a five-year maturity.
                              </p>
<p>The Management Board has considered the shareholding and governance
                              structures of SUSHI and determined that the Group lost control of
                              SUSHI on 21 November 2018. Subsequent to this date, Mattress Firm
                              will be accounted for as an equity accounted investment in the Group's
                              2019 annual financial statements.
                              </p>
<p>Shortly after the Mattress Firm Filing, but as part of that restructuring
                              plan, SUSHI launched an English law scheme of arrangement. The SUSHI
                              Scheme was sanctioned on 12 November 2018 and, following completion
                              of certain other steps (including recognition of the SUSHI Scheme
                              in proceedings under chapter 15 of title 11 of the United States Code
                              by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware
                              on 13 November 2018), became effective on 16 November 2018.

<p>The Hemisphere Lock-up Agreement was entered into by approximately
                              90% in value of the Hemisphere lenders and became effective on 26
                              July 2018. The Hemisphere Lock-up Agreement, among other matters,
                              imposed an agreed standstill obligation on lenders. This standstill
                              was aimed at facilitating the restructuring of Hemisphere by providing
                              the parties with a period of stability whilst the relevant documents
                              were negotiated.

<p>The restructuring of the financial indebtedness of Hemisphere was
                              implemented on 5 September 2018. This resulted in a new, secured,
                              three-year term loan facility of approximately €775 million at Hemisphere.
                              Since then, following the sale of the kika-Leiner related property
                              companies and certain other individual assets, approximately €473
                              million has been applied in repayment of interest and principal of
                              this facility by Hemisphere leaving a balance owing of approximately
                              €324 million.

                              CVA were filed with the English court. The SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA
                              seek to implement the restructuring plan outlined in the Lock-Up Agreement.
                              The CVA proposals, together with certain supporting documentation,

                              </p>
<p>(i) to revise the terms of the Group's principal European debt
                              instruments, and the guarantees of such debt instruments, to provide
                              a common set of covenants and security package and a maturity date
                              set sufficiently in advance (being 31 December 2021);
                              </p>
<p>(ii) as a result of those maturity dates, to afford the Group the
                              opportunity to seek to improve the value of its assets for the benefit
                              of its creditors and avoid a situation whereby SEAG's and SFHG's assets
                              would be realised in a distressed scenario, potentially reducing any
                              returns to SEAG's or SFHG's creditors;
                              </p>
<p>(iii) through the revised debt terms, to improve the Group's liquidity
                              position by providing that the interest accruing on the new debt pursuant
                              to the restructuring will be payment - in - kind (PIK), rather than
                              in cash;
                              </p>
<p>(iv) the PIK rate applicable to the New Lux Finco 1 Debt will be
                              10 per cent. per annum. The PIK rates applicable to the New Lux Finco
                              2 Debt will be: (i) 10% per annum in relation to a "Super Senior Facility
                              Loan"; (ii) 7.875% per annum in relation to a "Facility A1 Loan" or
                              a "Facility B1 Loan"; and (iii) 10.75% in relation to a "Facility
                              A2 Loan" or a "Facility B2 Loan". Such PIK interest rates may increase

                              to the Supervisory Board of the Company; and
                              </p>
<p>(v) The new SEAG debt facility contains provisions that regulate
                              the steps to be taken if the new SEAG HoldCo decides to undertake
                              a material asset disposal outside of a default scenario. If that material
                              asset disposal also requires a shareholder vote by the Company shareholders,
                              the matter will be put to the Company shareholders. If the Company
                              shareholders do not vote in favour of the sale there is a requirement
                              that within approximately 75 days the SEAG debt is prepaid in amount
                              equal to the net proceeds that would have been obtained on the proposed
                              sale. If the Company does not raise the required funds within the
                              required time to make the prepayment an event of default under the
                              new debt facilities will occur. For more details please refer to the
                              CVA Proposals and the new SEAG finance documentation.

                              to supplement and support the functions and specifications of those
                              holding companies including the appointment of new directors to certain
                              companies within the SEAG Group and the establishment of a litigation

<p>The total amount of such external European debt instruments under
                              the CVA is approximately €8.5 billion, being approximately €5.8 billion
                              of external SEAG debt and approximately €2.7 billion of external SFHG
                              debt).
                              </p>
<p>The meetings of the financial creditors and members of SEAG and
                              SFHG to vote on the SEAG CVA and SFHG CVA, as applicable, were held
                              on 14 December 2018. The SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA were each approved
                              by the requisite majorities of their respective creditors and by their
                              members.
                              </p>
<p>On 10 January 2019, SEAG was informed of an application issued
                              by LSW GmbH, a company claiming to be a creditor of SEAG, challenging
                              the SEAG CVA. LSW GmbH sought to challenge certain provisions of the
                              SEAG CVA and related matters.
                              </p>
<p>Aside from the challenge submitted by LSW GmbH, no challenges were
                              received to the SEAG CVA within the challenge period (i.e. the period
                              of 28 days beginning on the day on which the SEAG CVA Chairman's report
                              was filed at the competent court). No challenges were received to
                              the SFHG CVA within the applicable challenge period. As the challenge
                              periods had expired, no further challenges were permitted.
                              </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the challenge to the SEAG CVA, certain relevant
                              terms of the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA, including the interim moratoria,
                              continued to apply and the Group continued working towards the implementation
                              of the financial restructuring of the Group.
                              </p>
<p>On 28 March 2019, the Company and LSW GmbH agreed that the application
                              be dismissed on consensual terms. The parties accordingly filed with
                              the court a consent order giving effect to that agreement.
                              </p>
<p>On 29 March 2019, the Company announced that the requisite majority
                              of creditors of SEAG and SFHG had provided their consent to the extension
                              of the CVA long-stop date to 31 May 2019. The approval consequently
                              extended the long-stop date as defined in and as applicable to the
                              Lock-Up Agreement to be the same as the extended CVA LongStop Date.
                              </p>
<p>As a consequence of events that have occurred since the approval
                              of the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA, further amendments and modifications
                              to the SEAG CVA, the SFHG CVA and certain of the associated documents
                              are necessary. Whilst a number of these amendments are minor, technical
                              or administrative in nature, certain of them will require the approval
                              of the certain majorities of relevant creditors. SEAG and SFHG are
                              in the process of finalising the proposed amendments and it is anticipated
                              that SEAG and SFHG will request the relevant consents by way of a
                              separate CVA consent request in due course. It remains the objective
                              of the Group to complete the restructuring as soon as possible.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Conforama</h4>
<p>The French Commercial Court of Meaux approved an amicable restructuring
                              agreement entered into between Conforama and its creditors, as part
                              of a French law preinsolvency so-called "conciliation" process which
                              provided the framework for the refinancing negotiations. This ruling
                              allowed Conforama to proceed to implement its financial restructuring.
                              </p>
<p>The key terms of the financial restructuring included a total nominal
                              value of €316 million new money financing (including undrawn and conditional
                              commitments) and warrants in favour of the new money funders over
                              49.9% of the shares in Conforama. The first tranche of the funds amounting
                              to €205 million was made available on 15 April 2019.
                              </p>
<p>Alexandre Nodale stepped down as deputy CEO and member of the Management
                              Board following the issuance of this approval ruling on 11 April 2019.

                              steps
                              </h4>
<p>The SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA each require certain pre-conditions
                              and milestones to be reached prior to the restructuring being implemented.
                              The first of these milestones is the CVA effective date which has
                              now taken place following, among other things, the resolution of LSW
                              GmbH's challenge to the SEAG CVA.
                              </p>
<p>The Company is now working towards satisfying certain final implementation
                              conditions, including the satisfaction of conditions precedent under
                              the new finance documents. Once the implementation conditions have
                              been satisfied, the Company will implement the restructuring. At the
                              completion and satisfaction of the final restructuring step, the SEAG
                              CVA and SFHG CVA will have been fully implemented.

                              restatements due to accounting irregularities
                              </h4>
<p>On 5 December 2017, the Company announced that its 2017 Consolidated
                              Financial Statements could not be released when expected as it had
                              identified potential accounting irregularities and questionable transactions.
                              </p>
<p>As a result of these concerns, PwC was upon instruction of the
                              Supervisory Board retained by the Group's legal advisors to conduct
                              an independent forensic investigation. The audited 2016 Consolidated
                              Financial Statements could no longer be relied on and had to be restated
                              and publication of the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements was
                              postponed.
                              </p>
<p>The initial Investigation Report was produced on 11 March 2019.
                              The investigation is ongoing. The Investigation Report is confidential
                              and legal professional privilege inheres therein. Consequently, the
                              Investigation Report will not be published. Reference to the investigation
                              identified adjustments to the financial results, and the Investigation

                              notes thereto is made without waiving the privileged nature of the
                              Investigation Report. A number of accounting irregularities were identified
                              by the Management Board:

<p>The Management Board determined that certain other transactions,
                              which were not part of the investigation, required further consideration,
                              and were also assessed by the Management Board to have been inappropriately
                              recognised in the consolidated financial statements and required correction.

<p>The Management Board identified a number of transactions with four
                              principal groups of corporate entities which were not necessarily
                              on an arm's length basis. The four principal groups are: Campion and/

                              Fihag Group and certain individuals; Schmidt, Evans, Pasquier were
                              purportedly independent, but were in substance closely related and/or

<p>The Management Board have considered the nature and substance of
                              the Group's relationships with these respective parties. The Management
                              Board have considered whether Schmidt, Evans and Pasquier were related
                              parties and have considered whether they controlled entities in the

<p>The transactions entered into between the Group and entities within
                              the Campion Group and Talgarth Group included, amongst others, the
                              facilitation of business acquisitions and transactions that involved
                              the trading of Ordinary Shares. Funding in respect of such transactions
                              was mostly provided for by the Group. It appears that all, or the
                              majority of these transactions, were concluded on a non-arm's length
                              basis. The Management Board considered whether the Group controls
                              the Campion Group, Talgarth Group, TG Group and Fihag Group. Certain
                              of the Group's former executives and other non-Steinhoff executives,
                              who have subsequently resigned, were assessed to have a degree of
                              influence over the structure of the entities and the outcome of these
                              transactions and the Group is exposed to variable returns resulting
                              from the recoverability of the funding provided and the manner in
                              which the transactions were structured for the benefit of the Group.
                              However, although there are some indicators suggesting that the Group
                              might control the Talgarth, Campion, TG and Fihag Groups, no conclusive
                              information exists to confirm that the Group does in fact control
                              any of these Groups. In addition, the Management Board does not have
                              access to the financial information of either the Talgarth, Campion,
                              TG or Fihag Groups to be able to consolidate these entities. The Management
                              Board therefore accounted for the transactions with the respective
                              entities on a transaction by transaction basis to reflect the substance
                              of the underlying transactions and the Group's exposure. The Group
                              did not identify any direct transactions with Fihag or direct loans
                              outstanding during the period from 1 July 2015. Where transactions
                              were entered into within specific entities in the respective groups
                              it was considered whether the Group controlled the specific entity
                              it was transacting with, which has led to the consolidation of certain
                              entities within those groups. The recoverability of any loans and
                              assets with such counterparties has been assessed and where there
                              is no security on the loans in the entity with the liability or where
                              the Group does not have sufficient information to perform a recoverability
                              test, the Management Board has deemed it appropriate to impair these
                              assets.

<p>The 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements and its statement of
                              financial position as at 1 July 2015 have been restated to correct
                              prior period errors. As a result of the extent and complexity of the
                              restatements required to correct these errors, the Management Board
                              has grouped the restated transactions according to type and impact
                              on the consolidated financial statements. A brief explanation of each
                              grouping is discussed below with the detail of the restatements contained
                              in this note and the relevant section of the consolidated financial
                              statements.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Categories
                              of restatements:
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1. Property
                              transactions
                              </h4>
<p>Property should be recognised at depreciated cost, where cost is
                              measured at the date on which the Group acquires the property either
                              through acquisition or through gaining control of the entity owning
                              the property. The carrying value of the property should not be affected
                              if properties are transferred between Group entities. Information
                              that is now available has been used to reassess the control of entities
                              owning properties and the substance of property related transactions.
                              A number of transactions in which properties were transferred between
                              entities are now considered internal to the Group and therefore should
                              not have impacted the consolidated financial statements. This has
                              resulted in the reversal of some significant step ups in the cost
                              of properties.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2. Intangible
                              asset transactions
                              </h4>
<p>There are strict requirements under IFRS in relation to the recognition
                              of internally generated intangibles as assets. In the past, the Group
                              purportedly sold internally generated intangible assets (or entities
                              owning these assets) to so called independent parties, which were
                              then reacquired resulting in the recognition of the internally generated
                              intangible as a purchased intangible measured at fair value. In certain
                              instances the sale and repurchase of certain intangible assets acquired
                              from third parties were also stepped up. As a result profit and assets
                              were overstated, since the risks and rewards of ownership of the intangible
                              assets always remained within the Group.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">3. Accounting
                              for Group or related entities
                              </h4>
<p>The appropriate recognition of investments in consolidated financial
                              statements depends on the nature of the holding. Controlled entities
                              should be consolidated, jointly controlled entities should be equity
                              accounted on the same basis as entities over which the investor has
                              significant influence, with all other investments being recognised
                              at fair value. Where investments are recognised at fair value, adjustments
                              to fair value may only be recognised in profit or loss if specific
                              criteria are satisfied, failing which they are recognised in other
                              comprehensive income. The determination of the correct accounting
                              treatment is therefore dependent on correctly understanding the relationship
                              between the two entities as there are many other factors, in addition
                              to the size of the shareholding, that are relevant. As a result of
                              new information emerging, relating to loan financing, previously undisclosed
                              agreements, and more insight into the way in which decisions relating
                              to the investments were made, management has revised its assessment
                              of the appropriate method of recognising some of its investments.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">4. Contributions
                              and 'cash equivalents'
                              </h4>
<p>Any contributions received from independent third parties in relation
                              to trading activities should be recognised either as income or as
                              a reduction in expenses, with a receivable recognised to the extent
                              that payment has not been received at the time of the transaction.
                              The Group previously recognised certain contributions arising from
                              the so-called sale of Know-how and supplier volume rebates that lacked
                              economic substance and did not result in cash flows in to the Group,
                              which in turn resulted in an overstatement of profit. A restatement
                              is therefore required to reverse the aforementioned contributions
                              recognised in profit together with the related debit, which in some
                              cases had been incorrectly classified as "cash and cash equivalents"
                              instead of a receivable.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">5. Share transactions</h4>
<p>Where the acquisition of Ordinary Shares is funded by loan finance
                              from the Group that has no recourse to any asset other than those
                              shares, the borrower does not carry the risk of a decline in the share
                              price but will benefit from any increase in the share price above
                              the loan balance. The borrower's exposure is therefore effectively
                              the same as a purchased call option on the shares. The substance is
                              therefore that the funded shares are only treated as issued share
                              capital once the related loan financing has been settled. Any shares
                              that are issued prior to the settlement of the loan are therefore
                              reflected as treasury shares i.e. as a debit to equity. The optionality
                              granted to the borrower is in substance an equity settled share-based
                              payment, which results in an IFRS 2 related expense.
                              </p>

                              effects of accounting irregularities
                              </h4>
<p>The restatements as a result of the accounting irregularities has
                              consequential impacts on various other assets and liabilities of the
                              Group. The most material impacts related to; the impairment of goodwill
                              and brands due to the revision of inputs used in value-in-use calculations
                              of CGUs as a result of incorrect forecast information and revised
                              WACC rates, the taxation impact of fictitious income and expenses;
                              the reassessment of vesting criteria based on restated financial information
                              relating to employee share grants, the classification of external
                              debt as short term as a result of the technical breach of financial
                              covenants and the recognition of adjustments not previously considered
                              material to the Group.

                              by the Group in order to correct prior period errors in respect of

<p>The post-combination accounting of the following acquisitions was

<p>As a result of restatements arising from the correction of prior

                              of its segments. Historically, the Group presented three aggregated
                              segments, but in the interest of transparency and in compliance with
                              IFRS, the Group has restated its segments as eleven segments, details
                              of which are contained in note 2 to the 2017 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements. This presentation is aligned with how the Management Board
                              views the business and with historical operational reports.

<p>The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management
                              to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting
                              policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
                              </p>
<p>Actual results may differ from estimates, and judgements have been

                              </h4>
<p>Under IFRS, a liability should be classified as current if the
                              entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of
                              the liability for at least 12 months after the Reporting Date. As
                              the Group was in technical breach of a number of its covenants which,
                              relate to loans that were payable in future years subsequent to the
                              Reporting Date, until a restructuring plan is implemented, financial
                              creditors are not obligated to condone covenant breaches. The liabilities
                              are therefore required to be presented as current liabilities in the
                              2017 Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of restating the
                              2016 Consolidated Financial Statements, it appears that the Group
                              was in technical breach in prior years and the Group has therefore
                              restated the prior years' position to reflect these as current liabilities
                              as well.
                              </p>
<p>Once the finalised restructuring plan with financial creditors
                              becomes effective, a substantial portion of the current interestbearing
                              liabilities and borrowings will be reclassified to non-current interest-bearing
                              liabilities.

<p>The debt of the Group remains high, with net debt of €8.8 billion
                              at the Reporting Date. The net debt balance increased by €1.3 billion
                              in the Reporting Period. The major contributors to the increase were
                              funds secured by issuing European non-convertible bonds of €790 million,
                              a drawdown under the revolving multicurrency credit facility of circa
                              €800 million and a repayment was made under a syndicated term loan
                              of circa €500 million.
                              </p>
<p>On listing the Pepkor group separately in South Africa during September
                              2017, the Group sold a portion of its shares in Pepkor to non-controlling
                              interests and raised €1.0 billion from this transaction.
                              </p>
<p>In the prior year, the Group issued additional convertible bonds
                              raising €2.2 billion and did a capital raise by issuing shares during
                              September 2016. Total proceeds from the issuance of shares contributed
                              €1.7 billion.
                              </p>
<p>The Group generated €404 million from operations (2016: €998 million),
                              ordinary and preference dividends of €652 million (2016: €155 million)
                              were paid to shareholders and net interest and tax of €611 million
                              (2016: €609 million) was paid. This resulted in a cash outflow from
                              operations of €792 million (2016: inflow of €257 million).
                              </p>

                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">POCO</h4>
<p>In 2007, a joint venture was formed between companies affiliated
                              to Seifert, Pohlmann and the Group in respect of a German furniture
                              retailer, POCO. As at 1 July 2012, Seifert held a 50% interest in
                              POCO and Pohlmann and the Group each had a 50% interest in LiVest,
                              which held the other 50% interest in POCO thus giving the Group an
                              economic interest of 25%. Pohlmann agreed to provide the Group a casting
                              vote in respect of LiVest and as a result the Group also obtained
                              his casting vote in relation to the appointment of the key management
                              of POCO. The casting vote in POCO expired in March 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The Group historically incorrectly concluded that it controlled
                              POCO and consolidated POCO with no non-controlling interest. From
                              April 2015, the Group recognised a liability in respect of Seifert's
                              50% shareholding as it was believed that certain actions taken had
                              resulted in the Group's right to purchase his 50% shareholding, (the
                              "squeeze out").
                              </p>
<p>The Dutch POCO Proceedings was brought before the Enterprise Chamber
                              in 2015 by Seifert. Seifert argued that the consolidation of POCO
                              by the Group in the 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements was inappropriate.
                              The Enterprise Chamber in its judgment ruled that the Group was correct
                              to consolidate POCO in its 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements,
                              however, it ordered that the Group reflect a 50% non-controlling interest
                              related to Seifert and reverse the liability raised for the payment
                              of the 50% interest related to the squeeze out.
                              </p>
<p>On 30 September 2015, Steinhoff's effective interest in POCO increased
                              from 25% to 50% as the majority of Pohlmann's interest in LiVest was
                              swapped for Ordinary Shares in the Company. It is noted that in September
                              2018, Pohlmann instituted legal proceedings to have the share swap
                              set aside. A settlement agreement is currently being concluded and
                              the confidential settlement amount and related withholding taxes were
                              provided at the Reporting Date as The Management Board assessed this
                              to be an adjusting subsequent event.
                              </p>
<p>Taking into consideration the agreements entered into between various
                              parties, judgment has been applied in concluding that the casting
                              vote at a POCO level would provide the Group with control. The Management
                              Board has therefore concluded that POCO should be consolidated from
                              July 2007 up until March 2017. This is also in line with the ruling
                              of the Dutch POCO Proceedings that the Group controlled POCO.
                              </p>
<p>The Group derecognised POCO as a Subsidiary on 31 March 2017 and
                              recognised its 50% interest in POCO as an investment in equity accounted
                              companies under the recognition and measurement criteria of IAS 28
                              - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
                              </p>
<p>The assets and liabilities, as well as the non-controlling interest,
                              were derecognised line by line and an investment as an equity accounted
                              company recognised at its fair value of €301.5 million on 31 March
                              2017.
                              </p>
<p>The derecognition of POCO as a Subsidiary resulted in a profit
                              of €89 million in the Reporting Period. The impact of this change
                              is included in notes 4.2.6 and 10 of the 2017 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements. At the Reporting Date, an impairment to fair value of
                              €49 million was recognised.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Habufa</h4>
<p>The Group owned a 50% interest in Habufa, a wholesale facility
                              located in the Netherlands. The balance of the shares were owned by
                              the original family owners.
                              </p>
<p>It has come to the Management Board's attention that Habufa was
                              incorrectly consolidated with a 50% non-controlling interest in prior
                              periods. The accounting for Habufa has been restated to reflect the
                              accounting treatment of an equity accounted entity. Reference is made

<p>The Group has identified and tested various transactions that appear

                              also represented on the board of SRP. As such, the Group determined
                              that it had significant influence over SRP and it is therefore equity

<p>On 1 October 2017, an indirect subsidiary of Pepkor acquired 100%
                              of BSG for an enterprise value of ZAR645 million, subject to a clawback

                              Shoprite Holdings Limited from various parties. Pepkor's board exercised

<p>On 29 December 2017, the Group sold a property in Vienna, Mariahilferstrasse,
                              for a consideration of €70 million. The Group received partial payment
                              of €60 million at the end of December 2017 and a further €10 million
                              is payable in future by the purchaser. The kika-Leiner group held
                              this €10 million claim against the purchaser, so this claim formed
                              part of the kika-Leiner disposal. As such, it was not considered when

                              </h4>
<p>In January 2018, the Group took steps to assist the kika-Leiner
                              business to formulate a restructuring plan with the objective of avoiding
                              Austrian insolvency proceedings and of setting a course for it to
                              continue as a going concern. The kika-Leiner business has been loss-making
                              for a number of years (operating loss in 2017 of €92 million and in
                              2016 of €43 million) and has placed significant cash demands on the
                              wider Group. The agreed support plan for kika-Leiner required a significant
                              new investment from the Group over a number of years.
                              </p>
<p>The Group considered that it was making good progress with the
                              turnaround plan pursuant to the agreement of the kika-Leiner restructuring
                              plan. At the start of June 2018, a major credit insurer in Austria
                              decided to withdraw their credit insurance cover. This placed significant
                              new and additional liquidity constraints on the kika-Leiner businesses,
                              which resulted in the restructuring funds required for the restructuring
                              plan increasing to c. €125 million.
                              </p>
<p>In order to curtail the cash injection required from the Group
                              and to secure the future of kika-Leiner and its approximately 5.500
                              employees, the Group's management team engaged with various third
                              parties with a view to agreeing the terms of a sale of the kika-Leiner
                              Sale Assets. Agreement was reached with SIGNA Holding GmbH (as purchaser)
                              to acquire the kika-Leiner Sale Assets.
                              </p>
<p>The key terms of the disposals are set out below:</p>
<p>(i) Disposal of OpCos: Although the consideration for each of the
                              OpCos was a nominal amount, the Purchaser took over the Group's cash
                              commitment as per the restructuring plan. The sale of the OpCos received
                              merger clearance in each of Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia
                              by mid July 2018.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Disposal of PropCos: The consideration for the PropCos is
                              based on an enterprise value of approximately €490 million. The sale
                              of the PropCos received merger clearance and lender approval.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) In terms of accounting standards, these transactions are

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PSG</h4>
<p>In 2015, the Group made the strategic decision to increase its
                              PSG shareholding to above 25%.
                              </p>
<p>To facilitate the increase in its PSG shareholding, the Company
                              agreed with certain PSG investors to swap their PSG shares for Shares
                              in the Company. Two of the PSG investors that participated in the
                              swap, entered into a separate derivative agreements with the Company
                              in terms of which the Company would retain economic exposure to PSG
                              (therefore should the Company share price underperform the PSG share
                              price, the Company would pay out the difference in value to these
                              swap counterparties and should the Company share price outperform
                              the PSG share price, the Company would receive the difference in value).
                              </p>
<p>Prior to this disposal, the Company, through its indirect Subsidiary
                              Steinhoff Finance Investments (Proprietary) Ltd, held 56 million ordinary
                              shares in PSG, representing approximately 26% of the externally issued
                              share capital of PSG. During the Reporting Period, one of the derivative
                              contracts was cash settled for €1 million. During the 2018 Reporting
                              Period, the Company entered into the following sale agreements of
                              its investment in PSG:
                              </p>
<p>(i) Block placement of 21 million shares on 15 December 2017 at
                              a placement price of ZAR230 per share. The shares were taken up by
                              a consortium of bidders.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Accelerated book build of 29 million shares on 22 January
                              2018 at a price per share of ZAR240.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) A block of 3 million PSG shares were sold gradually on-market
                              for an average net price of ZAR210 per share.
                              </p>
<p>The remaining 2 million PSG shares were swapped for 6 million of
                              the Company's Ordinary Shares to settle the second PSG derivative
                              contract. On the Reporting Date, the statement of financial position
                              included a cumulative €13 million liability for the second PSG derivative
                              contract. As the PSG derivative was settled by the Company delivering
                              PSG shares (as opposed to cash), the €13 million liability on the
                              2017 statement of financial position was reversed in the 2018 financial
                              year, resulting in a once-off €13 million profit.
                              </p>
<p>Total proceeds of ZAR12 billion were received for all the sales
                              of PSG shares, net of transactions costs. A net profit before taxation
                              of ZAR375 million was recognised. At a Group level this profit before
                              taxation translates to c. €24 million. The reclassification of the
                              cumulative FCTR, which arose as a result of translation of the investment
                              in PSG at fluctuating ZAR:Euro exchange rates over the period of the
                              investment, resulted in a circa €99 million loss being recycled to
                              the income statement during the 2018 financial year.

<p>As stated above, in 2007, a joint venture was formed between companies
                              affiliated to Seifert, Pohlmann and the Group in respect of a German
                              furniture retailer, POCO. Seifert held a 50% interest in POCO and
                              Pohlmann and the Group each had a 50% interest in LiVest, which held
                              the other 50% interest in POCO, thus giving the Group an economic
                              interest of 25%. Pohlmann agreed to provide the Group a casting vote
                              in respect of LiVest and as a result his casting vote in relation
                              to the appointment of the key management of POCO, which would expire
                              in March 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The Group historically concluded that it controlled POCO and consolidated
                              POCO from July 2007 with a 50% non-controlling interest. As of January
                              2012, the Group incorrectly reduced its non-controlling interest to
                              0% and from April 2015 recognized a liability in respect of Seifert's
                              50% shareholding as it was believed that certain actions taken had
                              resulted in the right to redeem his 50% shareholding, known as a "squeeze
                              out". There was an ongoing dispute between the parties in Germany
                              on the validity of the so-called 'squeeze out'.
                              </p>
<p>Representatives of the Group and the other parties attended a court
                              hearing in Dortmund where this issue was contested on 25 April 2018.
                              At the hearing, the parties agreed, in principle, to settle the matter
                              on terms acceptable to all parties. To this end, it was agreed that
                              the Group would no longer contest the validity of the forfeiture of
                              the JV Entities' existing 50% interest in POCO. Furthermore, the JV
                              Entities offered to acquire the Group's remaining interest in POCO
                              based on an agreed equity valuation of €533 million for 100% of the
                              equity in POCO. In addition, the POCO business would retain debt of
                              approximately €140 million, with no recourse to the Group.
                              </p>
<p>The Group entered into a sale agreement with the JV Entities on
                              4 September 2018 for a total consideration of €271 million. The sale
                              was subject to competition and merger control provisions. Closing
                              the POCO sale brought the German litigation proceedings with the entities
                              owned by Seifert to an end.

<p>In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the 2017
                              Consolidated Financial Statements, the Management Board is required
                              to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence
                              for the foreseeable future.
                              </p>
<p>The Group and the Company's cash flow forecast indicate that the
                              Group and the Company can, based on certain critical assumptions,
                              continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, namely
                              for 12 months after the date of authorisation.
                              </p>
<p>The Management Board draw attention to the following critical assumptions
                              that are key in arriving at the cash flows, namely:
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Litigation</h4>
<p>The Group and Company has received several shareholder and vendor
                              claims and notices of regulatory investigation. A key assumption in
                              both the Group and Company cash flows is that no material claims or
                              fines are awarded against the Group or Company and will become payable
                              during the next twelve months. As stated previously, these legal proceedings
                              and regulatory investigations have been initiated against the Group
                              and Company during the past seventeen months. The Supervisory Board
                              and the Management Board, assisted by a newly constituted litigation
                              committee, and in consultation with the Group's attorneys, continue
                              to assess the merits of, and responses to, these claims, and provide
                              feedback to the regulatory bodies. Several initial defences have already
                              been filed by Steinhoff in these legal proceedings. However, litigation
                              remains a material uncertainty as to its ultimate impact on the liquidity
                              of the Group.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Tax</h4>
<p>Tax remains a material uncertainty as the tax impact of the accounting
                              irregularities identified and the consequential effects thereof remains
                              uncertain. This is exacerbated by the fact that these irregularities
                              impact multiple jurisdictions, the finalisation of which will require
                              substantial analysis and negotiation with various Tax Authorities
                              in the respective jurisdictions. A key assumption is therefore that
                              the tax assumptions built into the current cash forecast, for both
                              the Group and Company, continue to apply and that no unexpected material
                              assessments are received.

<p>The restructuring of the Group's existing financial indebtedness
                              continues. The fall implementation of the CVA is critical to the liquidity
                              of the Group. Should the CVA fail for any reason, this would have
                              a materially negative impact on the liquidity of the Group and the
                              Company.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Management Board draw attention to the following facts:</p>
<p>(i) that in both the Group and Company's financial statements current
                              liabilities exceed current assets, and
                              </p>
<p>(ii) that these material uncertainties extend beyond the foreseeable
                              future.
                              </p>
<p>These facts therefore cast significant doubt upon the Company and
                              Group's ability to continue as a going concern beyond the foreseeable
                              future. If the Group and Company is to continue as a going concern,
                              the Management Board and operational management require sufficient
                              time to stabilise the Group and re-establish value at operational
                              level. This will enable the Group and Company to realise assets in
                              a non-distressed fashion and thus maximise value to repay or reduce
                              debt to manageable levels. This will also maximise the return to all
                              stakeholders. At the same time a solution for the potential litigation
                              against the Group will need to be sought and implemented.

                              Plan
                              </h4>
<p>As stated above, PwC completed their investigation and delivered
                              the forensic report to the Supervisory Board and the Management Board
                              in mid-March 2019. The Company thereafter provided the market with
                              an overview of this report.
                              </p>
<p>After reviewing the findings of both the PwC report and its own
                              internal investigations, the Management Board have designed and drafted
                              a Remediation Plan aimed at addressing the cause of the various failures
                              and the consequential impacts.
                              </p>
<p>To ensure that the Remediation Plan is delivered upon, the Company
                              has appointed a Chief Compliance and Risk Officer (CCRO), Louis Strydom,
                              who will be responsible for the plan and will report directly to the
                              CEO and have reporting responsibility to the Audit and Risk Committee.
                              The CCRO will join the Group on 1 July 2019. Louis Strydom is well
                              versed in the issues facing the Steinhoff Group as he has been heading
                              up the PwC forensic team responsible for the PwC Steinhoff investigation.
                              </p>
<p>The Remediation plan is detailed and attempts to cover all the
                              potential weaknesses that have been identified to date and the regulatory
                              consequences thereof. It also identifies what still requires to be
                              done, who is responsible for performance and the timeline for delivery.
                              The Remediation Plan is a live document which will be expanded upon
                              as and when new issues arise and require change.
                              </p>
<p>The Remediation plan has been endorsed by the Supervisory Board
                              and the Supervisory Board will ultimately oversee the implementation
                              of the Remediation Plan.
                              </p>
<p>The Company is also considering findings from its own investigation,
                              and the contents of the forensic report, in order to pursue, where
                              appropriate, the recovery of losses incurred and damages suffered.
                              This represents an ongoing part of the Group's investigations.

                              a 12-month period, while the comparative 2016 Consolidated Financial
                              Statements represent a 15-month period, as a result of a change in
                              the financial year-end in 2016 from June to September. Where like-for-like

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Introduction</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Revenue</h4>
<p>During the Reporting Period, the Group reported revenue growth
                              of 17% to €18.8 billion against a comparative of €16.1 billion for
                              the 15-month period ended 30 September 2016. The revenue growth is
                              largely attributable to the acquisitions of Mattress Firm, Poundland
                              and Fantastic Furniture.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Profitability</h4>
<p>As a result of the accounting irregularities and their consequential
                              impact, the Group has significantly impaired certain non-operational
                              Group assets. These impairments and other one-off expenses are not
                              part of the segmental results summarised below and are described in

                              Part of "All other segments" in the 2017 Consolidated
                              Financial Statements.<br/>

</p>
<p>The operational results discussed below include restatements for
                              certain businesses within the segments. These restatements largely
                              relate to the historic receipt of contributions and profits from know-how
                              sales that have been reversed (for more details refer to the "prior
                              period restatements due to accounting irregularities" section in the
                              Financial Review). Pepkor Europe and the African operating entities
                              (including Pepkor, Automotive, African properties and the Group's
                              equity accounted investments (which is not part of the segmental reporting))
                              were not impacted by these restatements.
                              </p>
<p>A detailed reconciliation of Group revenue, EBITDA and operating
                              profit (including sustainable EBITDA and operating profit) is provided
                              below. For the Reporting Period, sustainable EBITDA for the Group
                              increased by 2% to €765 million (15MFY16:€753 million) and sustainable
                              operating profit for the Group decreased by 15% to €358 million (15MFY16:
                              €421 million).

                              Annual change is a mathematical calculation
                              of the 15-month 2016 financial period results  <sup>*</sup> 12/15. This
                              is not necessarily a true reflection of a 12-month growth rate as
                              it will not take into account factors such as seasonality.<br/>

</p>
<p>Pepkor Europe delivered a strong performance for the Reporting
                              Period. In central and eastern Europe, Pepco increased sales by 22%
                              to €991 million for the Reporting Period (15MFY16: €813 million).
                              The acquisition of Poundland added a further €1.8 billion of revenue.
                              </p>
<p>Operating profit increased to €168 million (15MFY16: €57 million),
                              while margin decreased, reflecting the impact of lower margin inherent
                              in the mix of categories served by Poundland.
                              </p>
<p>The Pepco business continues to progress strongly, delivering like-for-like
                              sales growth of more than 20% driven by strong growth in the clothing
                              and homewares categories, and expanding its store portfolio and geographic
                              footprint. Encouragingly, the business continued to show good growth
                              in all the territories in which it operates. During the Reporting
                              Period, Pepco added 238 new, with 23% (12MFY16: 28%) of sales generated
                              from stores less than 12 months old. Over 40% (12MFY16: 30%) of total
                              sales were generated outside of Poland, with Romania being the second-largest
                              market, contributing 13% of sales. During the Reporting Period, the
                              business entered two new countries (Croatia and Slovenia) where new
                              stores are trading significantly above initial expectations. Scale
                              benefits in buying and operating costs from both store expansion and
                              like-for-like growth continued to support margin growth.
                              </p>
<p>During the Reporting Period, Poundland delivered 2.8% like-for-like
                              sales growth, trading ahead of its acquisition plan in terms of both
                              revenue and margin growth. The introduction of a multi-price strategy
                              (introducing products at price points of £2 and £5) has proven successful.
                              Good progress has also been made in reducing the range size in order
                              to focus on core product categories and deliver operating efficiencies.
                              Poundland completed two significant restructuring projects during
                              the Reporting Period, realising the benefits identified at acquisition.
                              Firstly, following the integration of over 200 stores from the acquisition
                              of 99p Stores Ltd in 2015, a surplus warehouse and 60 stores were
                              closed, where these did not bring economic benefit to the UK portfolio.
                              Furthermore, Poundland Far East, a sourcing operation based in Hong
                              Kong, was formally merged with Pepkor Global Sourcing, a Pepkor Europe
                              groupwide sourcing entity. This merger will drive significant benefit
                              by reducing operating costs and leveraging increased buying scale
                              in key Far East sourcing markets.
                              </p>
<p>The PEP&amp;CO clothing brand continues to resonate strongly with
                              UK consumers, delivering double-digit like-for-like sales growth in
                              stand-alone stores. However, going forward, Pepkor Europe will focus
                              the development of PEP&amp;CO on creating shop-in-shop offers within
                              Poundland stores. This approach will not only offer a unique point
                              of differentiation for Poundland in the UK discount sector but also
                              significantly increase trading densities and economic returns in those
                              stores. During the Reporting Period, 111 PEP&amp;CO store-in-stores
                              were added within Poundland, with a further 171 planned for the 2018
                              Reporting Period. Furthermore, in the Reporting Period, 18 stand-alone
                              PEP&amp;CO stores were combined with Poundland stores where stores
                              are co-located.
                              </p>
<p>As at 30 September 2017, Pepkor Europe Limited was fully financed
                              via intercompany loans provided by subsidiaries of Steinhoff N.V.
                              Following the announcement of accounting irregularities in the Steinhoff
                              N.V. Group in early December 2017, an independent GBP260 million medium-term
                              financing facility was arranged, with the aim of stabilising Pepkor
                              Europe by providing ongoing working capital and repayment of parent
                              company loans.

                              Annual change is a mathematical calculation
                              of the 15-month 2016 financial period results  <sup>*</sup> 12/15. This

<p>During the Reporting Period, Conforama generated sales of €3.5
                              billion (15MFY16: €4.4 billion). Like-for-like sales for Conforama
                              decreased by 3%, largely as a result of reduced television sales in
                              France, where like-for-like sales decreased by 5%. The 2016 financial
                              period benefitted from particularly high television sales on the back
                              of the 2016 UEFA European Championship that was hosted in France.
                              Core like-for-like sales (excluding low-margin brown and grey goods)
                              were down by 1% for the Reporting Period.
                              </p>
<p>Conforama experienced a good fourth quarter sales performance in
                              the Reporting Period, driven by a successful 50th anniversary marketing
                              campaign.
                              </p>
<p>Sales momentum in Iberia continued to show good like-for-like growth.
                              This was supported by three new store openings in the territory during
                              the Reporting Period. The newly opened stores in Croatia and Serbia
                              continued to perform well. Sales in Italy were marginally below the
                              levels of the 2016 financial period.
                              </p>
<p>Digital remains a major focus area for Conforama, and in France
                              e-commerce accounted for 8% of sales during the Reporting Period.
                              </p>
<p>Operating profit decreased in the Reporting Period, driven by reduced
                              sales in France. Furthermore, the operating profit in the Reporting
                              Period declined against the 2016 financial period as a consequence
                              of an increased cost base in France, notably in marketing, stores
                              and headquarter costs. The cost base was further impacted by the roll-out
                              of new store concepts (such as Maison Depot) and several new projects
                              being launched (for example significant store refurbishments, merchandising
                              projects, supply chain and IT investments).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">POCO</h4>
<p>From April 2017, POCO's results no longer form part of the Group's
                              operational results, as the controlling vote in the POCO joint venture
                              expired in March 2017. Historically, this vote was cast after receiving
                              Steinhoff's approval, thus effectively giving Steinhoff control. During
                              March 2017, on expiry of the casting vote, for accounting purposes,
                              POCO has been changed from a 50% controlling interest to a 50% equity-accounted
                              interest. In line with the Group's equity accounting policy, POCO's
                              revenue is not included in Group revenue after March 2017.
                              </p>
<p>As explained in the Financial Review "Other disposals and transactions"
                              section, the Group entered into a sale agreement on 4 September 2018
                              for a total consideration of €271 million. The sale was subject to
                              competition and merger control provisions. Closing the POCO sale brought
                              the German litigation proceedings with the entities owned by Seifert
                              to an end.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">kika-Leiner</h4>
<p>In a challenging furniture market, like-for-like revenue decreased
                              by 2% for the Reporting Period, while the Group continued to make
                              losses. During the 2016 financial period, the kika-Leiner Group settled
                              a number of derivative instruments on its finance leases, resulting
                              in a one-off profit of €41 million being recognised in the 2016 financial
                              period.
                              </p>
<p>Effective 14 August 2018, the group sold the kika-Leiner operational
                              and property companies, as explained in more detail in the "kika-Leiner
                              disposal" paragraphs in the Financial Review.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">ABRA</h4>
<p>In a competitive market, like-for-like revenue declined by 6% while
                              margin decreased.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Extreme Digital</h4>
<p>Extreme Digital, the Group's online retail business in eastern
                              Europe, was acquired in January 2016 and reported a solid performance
                              in the Reporting Period.

<p>Reported results in the UK were impacted by a 13% devaluation of
                              the pound. In a challenging furniture market, like-for-like revenue
                              decreased by 3% for the Reporting Period while margin decreased.

<p>The bedding division (Bensons for Beds, representing 57% of the
                              UK Retail sales) reported a strong performance during the Reporting
                              Period. However, this was offset by a decline in trading in the loss-making
                              furniture business (Harveys). Harveys, a high fixed cost base business,
                              continued to be under margin pressure and various cost reduction initiatives
                              are being implemented in a market that is expected to remain very
                              challenging.

                              of 3%. The aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decreasing margin.

<p>Good revenue momentum was maintained in the business, and the increased
                              profitability achieved during the Reporting Period was most encouraging.
                              All divisions contributed to improved pro forma operating profit compared
                              with the 2016 financial period with Pepkor pro forma operating profit

<p>During a Reporting Period characterised by downbeat consumer confidence
                              and low growth, Pepkor delivered a solid operating performance. A
                              continued focus on price leadership and value offerings across Pepkor's
                              expanding store footprint drove market share gains in major retail
                              brands. For the Reporting Period, pro forma revenue increased by 13.2%
                              to ZAR58.6 billion (FY16PF: ZAR51.8 billion), and pro forma operating

<p>Notably, trading densities continued to rise above cost inflation
                              while Pepkor expanded its retail presence through trading space growth
                              of 5% to 2.3 million m  <sup>2</sup>  . Pepkor opened 272 stores on
                              a net basis, and the acquisition of Tekkie Town added 308 stores to
                              Pepkor's footprint. As at 30 September 2017, Pepkor traded from 4.953
                              retail locations.
                              </p>
<p>Pepkor's strategic focus on lowering the cost of doing business
                              and accessing new products and services through existing infrastructure
                              drove Pepkor's operating profit growth. The operating margin increased
                              by 100 basis points to 10.4% of total sales. PEP and Ackermans were
                              the main contributors to operating profit growth, in addition to the
                              turnaround of the furniture and appliances business.
                              </p>
<p>The discount and value division reported revenue of ZAR44.1 billion
                              and operating margin strengthened. Revenue growth was largely attributable
                              to PEP and Ackermans, which, in aggregate, account for 85% of divisional
                              revenue. Like-for-like revenue growth of 6.5% was achieved by PEP
                              and Ackermans in aggregate, influenced by a weaker fourth quarter.
                              Within product categories, kids' wear and cellular delivered stand-out
                              performances. Home, adult wear and FMCG also supported growth.
                              </p>
<p>The FLASH technology business, servicing customers in informal
                              communities, performed well, driven by a 23% increase in active traders
                              with the number of devices exceeding 121.000 at year-end.
                              </p>
<p>Following the closure of approximately 300 stores, the restructuring
                              of the furniture and appliances business is complete. Despite closing
                              uneconomic trading locations and the operational disruption caused
                              by the restructuring, the business increased revenue on a comparable
                              basis, reaching break-even at the operating profit level.
                              </p>
<p>Africa, being countries other than South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho,
                              Namibia and Swaziland (SA and BLNS), represents approximately 5% of
                              Pepkor's revenue. A constrained economic environment and currency
                              volatility in some of these countries continued to weigh on operations,
                              resulting in reduced momentum in store openings. In addition, adjustment
                              of product costing rates to manage exchange rate volatility slowed
                              growth in Angola.

<p>In a challenging market where new vehicle sales and commercial
                              vehicle sales volumes remain under pressure, the automotive retail
                              division in southern Africa reported good results in the Reporting
                              Period. Stronger pre-owned vehicle volumes, which operate counter-cyclical
                              to that of new vehicles, supported performance.

<p>Like-for-like revenue growth of 2% was achieved during the Reporting

<p>Despite the subdued economic environment, operating margins were

                              with its longstanding historic average of 3%.

                              The Mattress Firm acquisition became unconditional
                              on 30 September 2016. Previously, Mattress Firm had a different fiscal
                              year-end, and as a result no pro forma audited comparative is available
                              for the 2016 period. Sherwood results are reported from acquisition
                              date July 2017.<br/>

</p>
<p>During the Reporting Period, Mattress Firm reported disappointing
                              results with like-for-like revenue declining by 11% and a large operating
                              profit loss. Mattress Firm's performance was impacted by several strategic
                              and structural issues. The most significant structural challenge was
                              the large number of unprofitable stores and related costs. At the
                              same time, the costs and consequences of strategic decisions had a
                              negative effect on the customer proposition and the operational execution
                              resulted in the operating loss.
                              </p>
<p>These strategic decisions included:</p>

                              Chapter 11 process was conducted to allow Mattress Firm to restructure
                              its balance sheet, secure additional new funding, and optimise its
                              retail store portfolio by exiting 640 economically inefficient retail

<p>The acquisition of Fantastic Furniture (Fantastic) became effective

                              margin increased on the back of the Fantastic acquisition.

                              Financial Statements for further details).

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PSG derivative
                              contract
                              </h4>
<p>In 2015, the Group made a strategic decision to increase its PSG
                              shareholding to above 25%. In order to facilitate this increase in
                              the PSG shareholding, it agreed with certain PSG investors to swap
                              their PSG shares for Steinhoff shares. In two separate transactions,
                              two of the PSG investors that took part in the swap, entered into
                              derivative agreements with Steinhoff in which they would retain economic
                              exposure to PSG (therefore, should the Steinhoff share price underperform
                              to the PSG share price, Steinhoff would pay out the difference in
                              value, and should the Steinhoff share price outperform the PSG share
                              price, Steinhoff would receive the difference in value).
                              </p>
<p>During the Reporting Period one derivative contract was cash-settled
                              for €0.7 million. At 30 September 2017, the balance sheet included
                              a cumulative €13 million liability for the second PSG derivative contract.

                              </h4>
<p>The Management Board is responsible for managing the risks associated
                              with the Group's activities and report related developments to and
                              discusses the risk management and control systems with the Audit and

                              risk events
                              </h4>
<p>It is important at the outset to acknowledge that there were failures
                              in the Group's risk management framework that applied during the Reporting
                              Period arising from historic events. Accounting irregularities and
                              the failure of Corporate Governance had a significant impact on the
                              Group, affecting the results after the Reporting Date. The impact
                              of the December 2017 events indicated that the Group had inadequate
                              controls in place to mitigate against the irregularities uncovered
                              in the investigations and was unprepared for a sequence of events
                              of this nature. This has resulted in a re-evaluation of risks, which
                              were previously regarded as adequately mitigated, to be rerated in
                              terms of effectiveness of controls, severity of impact and likelihood
                              of occurrence. In turn this has resulted in the Remediation Plan being
                              designed and drawn up aimed at identifying and addressing all the
                              issues highlighted during the investigation. The outcome indicated
                              that our internal control environment was not aligned to our risk
                              appetite and tolerance thresholds. In hindsight, the Group's risk
                              tolerance thresholds were severely underestimated.

<p>The Group draws on global standard ISO 31000 - Risk management
                              and the DCGC to formulate its risk management policy and framework,
                              and to facilitate the timeous identification, measurement, analysis,
                              evaluation and treatment of risk. Risk management responsibility remains
                              with management of individual operational entities and the processes
                              established by the risk management policy and framework have been
                              designed to allow each operational entity to identify, evaluate and
                              treat risk appropriately to ensure effective risk control mechanisms
                              are implemented to mitigate residual risk exposure. Risks which are
                              considered material, are to be escalated to the Management Board and
                              the Audit and Risk Committee, who in turn are to report such risks
                              to the Supervisory Board for consideration. The risk management framework
                              is reviewed and monitored by the Audit and Risk committee to safeguard
                              ongoing risk management maturity. Each of the Group's operational
                              entities is required to have an individual risk management plan in
                              place which is tailored to the specific risks of the relevant entity,
                              together with an up-to-date risk register detailing, quantifying and
                              prioritising risks, as well as action plans for improvement both to
                              mitigate risks and to exploit identified opportunities.
                              </p>
<p>The internal control and risk management systems and processes
                              are to take the following into account:
                              </p>
<p>(i) strategic direction and objectives of the business;</p>
<p>(ii) nature and extent of risks facing the business;</p>
<p>(iii) extent and categories of risks regarded as acceptable;</p>
<p>(iv) likelihood of identified risks materialising and their impacts;</p>
<p>(v) ability of the business to reduce the incidence and impact
                              on the business if risks materialise;
                              </p>
<p>(vi) effectiveness of the implemented risk response plans; and</p>
<p>(vii) cost of risk response plans and processes relative to the
                              exposure and benefits obtained.
                              </p>
<p>The purpose of the internal control and risk management systems
                              and processes, is to ensure that uncertainties originating from the
                              internal and external environment, and which could potentially have
                              a material impact on the Group, are adequately managed to ensure objectives
                              are reached by mitigating threats and/or realising opportunities.
                              The internal control and risk management process involves, the coordinated
                              and economical application of activities and resources, to minimise
                              the negative impacts of risks, to levels which can be tolerated by
                              stakeholders, while optimising the opportunities or positive impacts
                              of all risks.
                              </p>
<p>The Group risk management and internal control framework has been
                              designed to allow each operational entity to set their risk tolerances
                              through analyses of the operational and financial objectives of the
                              relevant entity, strategy evaluation based on objectives, the Code
                              of Conduct, delegation of authority, annually approved budgets, policies
                              concerning financial reports and the procedures, as well as a system
                              of monitoring and reporting. The risk management objective is to ensure
                              that uncertainties are responsibly managed with consideration of stakeholder
                              interests to ensure that both risks and opportunities are optimally
                              managed.

<p>Developments in relation to risk assessments, internal control
                              and risk reviews and measures proposed in view of assessed risks are
                              subjects of regular discussions within the Audit and Risk Committee.
                              The Internal Auditor is present during such discussions, during which
                              follow-up measures are also considered and reviewed. The Supervisory
                              Board is informed of these discussions and evaluations on a regular
                              basis.

<p>Guidance was provided during the Reporting Period to operational
                              management teams on how to assess their risk appetite and tolerance
                              as part of the Group risk management methodology. Risk thresholds
                              were set with reference to operational strategy, the Code of Conduct,
                              core principles and values, authority schedules, policies and corporate
                              directives. The Group's risk appetite during the Reporting Period
                              differed per objective area and type of risk but has reduced substantially
                              post December 2017:
                              </p>
<p>(i) strategic risks: uncertainties that impact the achievement
                              of strategic plans of the Group and influence the achievement of long-term
                              goals. In pursuing the Group's strategy, the Group was prepared to
                              take calculated risk related to achieving its performance and sustainability
                              objectives;
                              </p>
<p>(ii) operational risks: uncertainties that affect the effectiveness
                              and efficiency of the Group's current businesses and operations and
                              influence the shortterm goals. With respect to operational risks,
                              the Group sought to minimise the downside risk from the impact of
                              unforeseen operational failures within the businesses;
                              </p>
<p>(iii) financial risks: uncertainties with respect to the Group's
                              financial position, for example: withdrawal of facilities, price risk,
                              liquidity risk, exchange risk and interest rate risk. With respect
                              to financial risks, the Group professed to have a prudent financing
                              strategy and a strict cash management policy in place.
                              </p>
<p>(iv) IT risks: uncertainties that the information technologies
                              used in the organisation (a) are not operating as intended; (b) are
                              compromising the integrity and reliability of data and information;
                              (c) are exposing significant assets to potential loss or misuse; or
                              (d) are exposing the Group's ability to sustain the operation of critical
                              processes. The Group aimed to meet the highest standards of IT governance
                              to ensure both its own systems and customer information was well protected;
                              </p>
<p>(v) legal and compliance risks: uncertainties with respect to laws
                              and regulations that have a direct impact on the Group's organisation
                              and/or business processes and operations. The Group professed a "no
                              tolerance" approach to compliance risk and would take appropriate
                              measures in the event of reported breaches of the Group's Code of
                              Conduct;
                              </p>
<p>(vi) information for decision making risks: uncertainties that
                              information used to support the execution of the business model, the
                              internal and external reporting on performance and the continuous
                              evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group's business model is not
                              relevant or reliable. These risks relate to every aspect of the Group's
                              value creation activities and the Group professed to ensure that information
                              reported was as accurate and up to date as possible through effective
                              assurance mechanisms and management feedback.
                              </p>
<p>The risk appetite for the legal and compliance risk remains unchanged:
                              noncompliance to any legal and compliance requirements is not acceptable.
                              The tolerance for fraud risk, in particular, exceeded the Group's
                              desired risk thresholds and resulted in catastrophic losses. Considerable
                              measures have been introduced by both the Management Board and the
                              Supervisory Board to improve the controls around legal and compliance
                              risk, in order to ensure that fraud risk is effectively mitigated
                              to the prescribed threshold. The Remediation Plan provides detailed
                              internal control improvements required to assist with the prevention,
                              monitoring and remediation of the breaches in the internal control
                              environment.

<p>A summary of the material risks identified during the Reporting
                              Period are presented in the table below. The Management Board in place
                              during the 2017 Reporting Period determined that the Group's business,
                              its financial condition and/or the results of operations could have
                              been materially and adversely affected by the material risks identified
                              below. The mitigating actions and context of the risks are based on
                              the Reporting Period and the information available during that period.

<p>Economic slowdown/slow recovery During the Reporting Period, the
                              Group identified that its ability to increase sales, maintain or increase
                              prices and/or to recover fixed costs may have been adversely affected
                              by volatile economic conditions. Historically, the household goods,
                              general merchandise and automotive industries have been cyclical,
                              fluctuating with economic cycles and conditions. Demand was deemed
                              to be sensitive to general economic conditions, including housing
                              activity, interest rate levels, current economic growth, credit availability,
                              unemployment and other factors that affect consumer spending habits.
                              Due to the discretionary nature of most household goods, general merchandise
                              and automotive purchases, and the fact that they often represent a
                              significant expenditure to the average consumer, such purchases may
                              be deferred during times of economic uncertainty. These general economic
                              factors affected not only the ultimate consumer, but also impacted
                              the Group's owned and third-party mass and specialty retailers, which
                              are the Group's primary customers for wholesale and distribution of
                              its manufactured and sourced products.
                              </p>
<p>Low-growth consumer markets existed despite growth in the world
                              economy. A low-demand growth environment remained prevalent in the
                              developed world and retailing in Europe was viewed as a zero-sum game
                              where one player's gain is another's loss. Similarly, economic growth
                              forecasts remained weak and were below 1% and 2% respectively for
                              Southern African countries.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Achieving efficiencies and reducing costs by optimising operations
                              without compromising quality of goods or service delivery. Ongoing
                              initiatives include standardising processes, centralising procurement,
                              and efficiently deploying staff.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Leveraging the Group integrated supply chain activities to
                              accelerate productivity, efficiency and innovation including the automation
                              of key administrative and financial processes.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Regular supplier negotiations in order to leverage Group
                              buying power and achieve economies of scale.
                              </p>
<p>The medium risk rating has been adversely affected by the events
                              of December 2017. The risk remains significant and continues to impact
                              operating companies post the Reporting Period.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Failure to
                              execute acquisition growth plans
                              </h4>
<p>The Group identified that its growth objectives could have been
                              adversely affected if it was unable to execute and integrate acquisitions
                              effectively.
                              </p>
<p>The Group completed several strategic acquisitions and joint-venture
                              arrangements over the preceding years, which have historically contributed
                              to the expansion of its business and operations. During the Reporting
                              Period, the Group identified that its ability to continue to grow
                              in new markets was dependent on its success in identifying and concluding
                              appropriate acquisitions and joint-venture arrangements. Moreover,
                              the Group's future operating results were deemed to be largely dependent
                              upon its ability to manage and integrate acquisitions effectively.
                              The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions could have negatively
                              impacted the profitability of the acquired businesses, as well as
                              resulted in the impairment of the Group's intangible assets, including
                              goodwill. Successfully integrating new acquisitions was deemed to
                              be critical to the Group's brand and reputation and if unsuccessful,
                              the Group may not have been able to manage the continuing expansion
                              of its business effectively. The Group's management structures, systems,
                              procedures or controls may not have been adequate or sufficiently
                              developed to support the continued expansion of its operations. Furthermore,
                              management may not have been able to allocate the time and resources
                              necessary to effectively manage this expansion.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Implementation of an effective business growth strategy and
                              leveraging best practices to ensure optimised operational process
                              for efficiency and cost management.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Performance delivery plans that cover growth across all divisions
                              / territories.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Regular review of divisional development plans.</p>
<p>(iv) Investing in capital projects focused on new revenue generation.</p>
<p>The control environment has been highlighted as poor by the events
                              of December 2017. This risk is significant and continues to impact
                              operating companies post the Reporting Period.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Increasing
                              competition
                              </h4>
<p>The household goods, general merchandise and automotive retail
                              markets are generally fragmented and highly competitive and consist
                              of a large number of manufacturers and retailers that produce and
                              distribute products similar to those of the Group. Notwithstanding
                              the Group's own sourcing abilities, the added competition and flexibility
                              of competitors (and customers) that are able to supply a mix of sourced
                              and manufactured products placed, additional pressure on the Group's
                              operations and competitive advantages. The Group also faced intensified
                              competition in the e-commerce sector due to lower barriers of entry
                              and the development of the online market for certain classes of products.
                              </p>
<p>Competition is generally based on product quality, timing of delivery,
                              product design, product availability, brand name recognition, price
                              and customer service. In certain of the Group's markets, the Group
                              competed with a limited number of large companies that may have greater
                              financial and other resources at their disposal. Additionally, the
                              Group also faced competition in the multiple geographic markets it
                              competes in including the general merchandise, household goods and
                              automotive retail. The Group identified that its success in these
                              markets, and across these product categories, depended largely on
                              its ability to identify customer preferences and translate such demand
                              into appropriately priced, saleable merchandise in a timely manner.
                              If the Group did not correctly interpret trends and respond appropriately,
                              there was a risk of losing its target customers to competing retailers.
                              As a result, the Group may have been exposed to a loss of market share
                              or be left with excess or slow-moving inventory, in which case it
                              would have been forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales,
                              thereby reducing its revenue and margins.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Expanding core businesses into areas where there is increased
                              demand and less competition.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Attract the appropriate merchandisers</p>
<p>(iii) Store expansion plans.</p>
<p>(iv) E-commerce growth initiatives.</p>
<p>(v) Factors that influence decisions to invest include population

<p>The low Risk Rating has been adversely affected by the events of
                              December 2017. The risk has increased significantly and will continues
                              to impact operating companies post the Reporting Period.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Failure to

                              </h4>
<p>Failure to innovate and/or meet customer needs was deemed to be
                              a significant risk due to the changes in consumer behaviour, and constant
                              innovation of products and service offerings required from retailers.
                              Emerging trends indicated that there was an increasing use of mobile
                              technology among the emerging generation of people who would rather
                              browse products on a mobile device than visit traditional brick and
                              mortar stores. Distribution channels and volume sales are required
                              to make this alternative business model profitable. During the Reporting
                              Period, consumers reduced consumption, cut back on spending, and increasingly
                              used online price-comparison sites. Despite the urgency and massive
                              investment of time and money, innovation remained a frustrating pursuit.
                              </p>
<p>Innovation initiatives often fail but successful innovations can
                              lead to competitive advantages, allowing for unique brand positioning
                              and differentiation, establishing brand reputation equity, and increased
                              profitability.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Constant review of the competitor landscape to identify trends
                              and possible acquisitions.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Active investment in IT to remain aligned with consumer requirements.</p>
<p>(iii) Investment by operations into a multichannel approach to
                              sales that seeks to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience,
                              whether they are shopping online from a desktop or mobile device,
                              by telephone, or in a brick-and-mortar store.

<p>The CEO, executive management and management of operational entities
                              were regarded as key to the long-term sustainability of the business.
                              A lack of clear succession planning and training could have adversely
                              impacted on investor confidence in the short term and disrupted strategic
                              initiatives in the long term. The Group depended on the skills and
                              experience of the CEO and the senior executive officers. The Group
                              identified that its strategic development depended, in part, on the
                              continued contributions of the CEO who was experienced in the markets
                              and business in which the Group operates. The loss of the services
                              of the CEO and/or certain senior executive officers would negatively
                              impact the Group's operations and its ability to develop the business.
                              </p>
<p>The Group's success was identified as being dependent on its ability
                              to manage, attract and retain skilled and qualified personnel as management
                              worked to continue the development and expansion of the business.
                              Competition for skilled employees in the industries in which the Group
                              operates is intense, and the Group could not be certain that it would
                              have been successful in managing, attracting and retaining the personnel
                              required to successfully conduct its operations. The Group determined
                              that competition for available skills will continue to intensify.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>

<p>The risk rating has been adversely affected by the events of December
                              2017. This is a significant risk and continues to impact operating
                              companies post the Reporting Period.

                              reputation / brand
                              </h4>
<p>Unforeseen disasters, circumstances or actions of directors, officers,
                              employees or peripheral parties, such as suppliers or joint venture
                              partners was identified as a risk that could do untold damage to the
                              Group's reputation.
                              </p>
<p>From occurrences such as fraud, product recall or supply issues,
                              public perception can cause a company's value to drop dramatically.
                              The Group determined that it operates in highly competitive markets
                              and may have been unable to conclude transactions to expand its business
                              with a damaged reputation. Investor confidence and the ability to
                              secure lending facilities may have been impacted by a significant
                              damage to reputation. A damaged brand/reputation could have resulted
                              in the Group facing increased competition from other leading retailers
                              for market share growth opportunities, and an inability to take advantage
                              of perceived consolidation opportunities. Either event would have
                              adversely affect the Group's ability to successfully maintain and
                              grow its market share.
                              </p>
<p>The Group considered its potential exposure to product liability
                              claims that could have result in loss of reputation. The packaging,
                              marketing, distribution and sale of the Group's products entail an
                              inherent risk of product liability, product recall and resultant adverse
                              publicity. Products may contain contaminants or be of inferior quality,
                              which could result in illness, injury or death. As a consequence,
                              the Group identified its exposure to product liability claims. If
                              a product liability claim was successful, the Group's insurance may
                              not have been adequate to cover all liabilities that it may have incurred
                              and the Group may not have been able to continue to maintain such
                              insurance or obtain comparable insurance cover at a reasonable cost,
                              if at all. In addition, even if a product liability claim was unsuccessful
                              or not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion
                              that the Group's products caused injury could have adversely affect
                              the Group's reputation and, consequently, its business, results of
                              operations or financial condition.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Proactive management of issues that arise, with key managers
                              providing accurate and balanced responses to adverse press coverage.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Development of plans which focus on the Group's responses
                              to specific incidents.
                              </p>
<p>The low risk rating has been adversely affected by the events of
                              December 2017. This risk is significant and continues to impact operating
                              companies post the Reporting Period.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Supply chain
                              risk
                              </h4>
<p>The failure of the supply chain was deemed to be a significant
                              risk due to the Group's dependency on the efficiency of its logistics
                              networks, which include the movement of raw materials and finished
                              goods primarily by way of road, rail and sea, and the delivery of
                              final products to end users.
                              </p>
<p>The following supply chain risks were specifically highlighted:</p>
<p>(i) The primary means by which the Group transports its goods is
                              via ocean-borne containers and road transport. The Group contracts
                              with third parties to ship cargos by ocean-borne container. Transport
                              by ocean-borne container involves particular risks, including the
                              risk of delay in transport and loss of and/or damage to the cargo
                              due to factors beyond the Group's control. These factors include adverse
                              natural conditions, such as violent storms, tidal waves and tsunamis,
                              as well as terrorist attacks and piracy, which has increased in frequency.
                              The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse impact
                              on the Group's cost of operations.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Damage to central warehouse and distribution centres could
                              have resulted in business interruptions and loss of income which was
                              a significant risk to the Group.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Despite ongoing investment in the Group's logistics network,
                              the Group remained vulnerable to external risks beyond its control,
                              such as the failure of third-party suppliers to ensure that the appropriate
                              quality and quantity of goods are shipped, as well as possible delays
                              to delivery that could be caused by disruption to the Group's distribution
                              networks. The risk of delay in the delivery of goods was deemed to
                              be particularly significant in instances where large amounts of goods
                              were shipped ahead of peak trading seasons, a prolonged delay in delivery
                              could significantly impact the Group's profitability for that period.
                              The delivery of goods from suppliers may be delayed by customs, labour
                              issues, changes in political, economic and social conditions, laws
                              and regulations. Unfavourable fluctuations in the availability of
                              products could negatively affect the Group's ability to meet the demands
                              of its customers and have a negative impact on product margin. Moreover,
                              while the Group strategically targeted its investment in its own warehousing
                              and logistics technologies, no assurances could have been given that
                              the Group's focused investment would earn a sufficient return on such
                              investments in its fulfilment facilities.
                              </p>
<p>(iv) The Group sourced various types of raw materials for the production
                              of the furniture and household goods sold in its retail outlets and
                              to third-party retailers, including wood, fabrics, leathers, glass,
                              upholstered filling material, steel and other commodities, on a global
                              and regional basis. The sources and prices of these materials and
                              components were deemed to be susceptible to significant price fluctuations
                              due to supply and demand trends, transportation costs, government
                              regulations and tariffs, the economic climate and other circumstances
                              beyond the Group's control. In particular, volatility in oil markets
                              led to significant fluctuations in the price of petroleum-based products,
                              which affects the cost of the Group's polyurethane foam, polyester,
                              polyethylene foam and steel innerspring component parts.
                              </p>
<p>(v) The Group's suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could
                              have chosen to discontinue business with the Group or change the terms
                              under which they are willing to do business, such as price, minimum
                              quantities, required lead times or payment terms. Fluctuations in
                              the price, availability or quality of (i) the raw materials the Group
                              used in manufacturing its products or (ii) the products it sourced
                              could have resulted in a negative impact on the Group's cost of sales
                              and its ability to meet the demands of its customers. In the event
                              of a significant disruption in the Group's supply of raw materials
                              or sourced products, the Group may not have been able to locate alternative
                              sources at an acceptable price or in a timely manner. In addition,
                              if the price of raw materials increased, the Group determined that
                              it may not have been able to pass on to customers all or a portion
                              of the higher costs, due to competitive and market pressures.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Vertical and horizontal supply chain integration.</p>
<p>(ii) Strict service delivery agreements with suppliers.</p>
<p>(iii) Use of multiple suppliers in multijurisdictional parts of
                              the world.
                              </p>
<p>(iv) Adequate insurance coverage for marine transit globally.</p>
<p>(v) Adequate insurance coverage for business interruption.</p>
<p>The low risk rating has been adversely affected by the events of
                              December 2017. This risk rating has increased significantly and continues
                              to impact operating companies post the Reporting Period.

<p>During the Reporting Period, the Group's operations remained subject
                              to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operated,
                              relating to inter alia such matters as health and safety, employment
                              and environmental issues. Historically, compliance with these laws
                              and regulations has been high as it has not resulted in material costs
                              or had any material adverse effect on the Group's operations. However,
                              if the Group failed to comply with any such laws or regulations, it
                              could have resulted in exposure to liability, including, but not limited
                              to, mandatory shutdowns, damages, criminal prosecutions, and financial
                              penalties, loss of trade agreements and contracts, and injunctive
                              action.
                              </p>
<p>Changes to the industry legislative landscape and compliance environment
                              could have an adverse impact on operations and, in severe cases, result
                              in prosecution due to non-compliance. Potential anticompetitive conduct
                              was considered as a risk due to the risk of broader enforcement action
                              by multiple authorities and the risk of follow-on damages claims in
                              any number of jurisdictions. The Group's operations were subject to
                              certain anti-competition legislation and regulatory oversight.
                              </p>
<p>Expansions of its operations through acquisitions may require regulatory
                              approval. While, to date, all acquisitions have been approved by regulatory
                              authorities, it is possible that, in the future, the Group may not
                              receive approval to make additional acquisitions or that such approval
                              may be subject to various conditions which could affect its ability
                              to expand its operations in that market. From an acquisitive growth
                              perspective, any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material
                              adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition or results
                              of operations.

<p>Tax Compliance - If the Group's transfer pricing arrangements are
                              determined to be inappropriate, the Group's tax liability may increase.
                              The Group has transfer pricing arrangements in place in relation to
                              various aspects of its business, including its retail, manufacturing
                              and distribution functions. Transfer pricing regulations in the countries
                              in which the Group has operations require that any international transaction
                              involving associated enterprises be on arm's length terms. The Group
                              considered the transactions among its businesses to be substantially
                              on arm's length terms. The Group is currently subject to ongoing,

                              practices and determines that the transfer prices and terms that the
                              Group has applied are inappropriate, or that other income of a division
                              of the Group should be taxed in that jurisdiction, the Group may incur
                              increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties,
                              which would cause the Group's tax expense to increase.

<p>Risk mitigation activities during the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) Dedicated internal and external resources that continuously
                              monitor the regulatory environment with concerns escalated to executive
                              management and divisional boards.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Actively engaging with regulators on policy decisions, which
                              enables us to proactively amend our strategy and business model when
                              required.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Policies and internal legal specialist advisors provide additional
                              support.
                              </p>
<p>(iv) An integrated audit plan which includes compliance monitoring.</p>
<p>(v) Scheduled regulatory training for staff. The medium risk rating
                              has been adversely impacted by the events of December 2017. This risk
                              rating has increased significantly.

                              risk
                              </h4>
<p>During the Reporting Period, the Group identified that there was
                              a distinct rise of cyber dependency due to increasing digital interconnection
                              of people, things and organisations. The possibility of cyber risks
                              affecting global operations was increasing every year with data fraud/
                              theft and large-scale cyber-attacks listed as critical risks. A massive
                              incident in data fraud/theft could have resulted in wrongful exploitation
                              of private data that takes place on an unprecedented scale, whereas
                              a large-scale cyberattack or malware causing large economic damages,
                              geopolitical tensions or widespread loss of trust in the internet
                              could have a major impact on future plans of the Group. This cyber
                              dependency further increased vulnerability to outage of critical information
                              infrastructure (e.g. internet, satellites, etc.) and networks, causing
                              widespread disruption. This risk used to be more prevalent in developed
                              economies, with North America having the greatest exposure. The increasing
                              global cyber dependency has created an environment where a cyber event
                              can originate from any point infecting the global network and infrastructure.
                              </p>
<p>The Group completed a cyber security survey via an independent
                              third party in 2016 to determine the cyber security resilience and
                              readiness within the Group. The survey highlighted the current maturity
                              of the Group cyber security and indicated that the Group remains dependent
                              on the permanent and uninterrupted availability of its IT systems
                              and IT infrastructure provided by third parties. Telecommunication
                              problems, software errors, inadequate capacity at IT centres, threat
                              of fire, large-scale electricity outages and cyberattacks by third
                              parties were identified as significant risks and additional controls
                              were required to effectively mitigate these risks. Prolonged or recurring
                              breaches to the network and damage to technical systems which interrupt
                              the contractual provision of services to customers was also identified
                              as a risk that could lead to contractual claims for non-performance
                              and/or penalties resulting in the loss of customer's revenues.
                              </p>
<p>The transformation of administrative systems and processes remains
                              a priority throughout the Group. This transformation must be achieved
                              while ensuring that IT systems remained stable and the Group companies
                              are rapidly able to restore system functionality in the event of a
                              systems failure. Cyber security featured more prominently in board,
                              audit and senior management discussions.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities during this Reporting Period:</p>
<p>Existing control mechanisms included operational cyber security
                              systems, IT security policy, data protection, physical access security,
                              access protection, user administration and IT planning. However, loss
                              of data or an extended failure of the network will have significant
                              impacts on short-term operational activities. The systemic, intangible
                              and constantly evolving nature of cyber threats presented significant
                              challenges for gathering the data required to achieve accurate quantification
                              of the risk that could trigger a wide range of economic losses on
                              a global basis.

<p>(ii) Continually investing in IT infrastructure to optimise facilities
                              management by facilitating accurate record keeping and removing duplication
                              and processes that add unnecessary costs.

                              enhancement.
                              </p>
<p>(vii) Continuous maturing and enhancing IT security measures.</p>
<p>(viii) Increased focus by regional operational Boards to ensure
                              compliance with regulatory requirements.
                              </p>
<p>(ix) Ensuring that cyber security and IT risk features more prominently
                              in strategic business plans and Senior Management discussions.

<p>Although the Group operated a decentralised management and business
                              strategy during the Reporting Period, liquidity risk for the Group
                              was controlled and monitored centrally through the Group executive
                              management by tracking the development of the actual cash flow position
                              for the Group and used input from a number of sources in order to
                              ensure an acceptable overall liquidity position on both short and
                              longterm basis.
                              </p>
<p>During the Reporting Period a significant level of available facilities
                              for draw down was maintained to ensure that sufficient liquidity was
                              available to meet liabilities when due. Group treasury maintained
                              the relationships and engaged with the multiple financial institutions
                              to source funding from a diversified Group of funders inter alia,
                              banks, and investment and asset managers. The Group established commercial
                              paper programme in South Africa and has successfully issued bonds
                              in Europe, German loan notes (Schuldschein), redeemable preference
                              shares as well as perpetual preference shares.
                              </p>
<p>There was a risk that the rating of the Company's debt, by major
                              rating services, may have improved or deteriorated. As a result, the
                              future borrowing capacity may have been influenced, and the financing
                              costs may have fluctuated. During the Reporting Period cash from subsidiaries
                              was pooled to the extent legally and economically feasible. Cash flow
                              from operations depended on the performance of the individual businesses
                              and may have been influenced by external factors such as the economic
                              and socio-political environment.
                              </p>
<p>The Group determined that it was exposed to fluctuations in currency
                              exchange rates. The Group identified its exposure to foreign exchange
                              risk as a result of its business model, which includes the strategy
                              of sourcing finished products and raw materials from facilities in
                              emerging, low-cost economies and supplying finished products into
                              developed economies. As a result, volatility in the exchange rates
                              between the countries where the Group sources and produces its products
                              and the countries where it sells its products could have had a negative
                              impact on the Group's operating margins. While the Group's sourcing
                              and manufacturing costs were incurred principally in Chinese yuan,
                              Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, South African rand and US dollar,
                              the Group's revenues derived outside Africa were earned principally
                              in Australian dollar, euro, Polish zloty, Swiss franc, US dollar and
                              UK pound sterling. Accordingly, any significant and sustained appreciation
                              of the currencies in which the Group incurs sourcing and manufacturing
                              costs against the currencies in which the Group earns revenues would
                              adversely affect the Group's operating margins, thereby reducing its
                              gross profit. Furthermore, the Group reports its results in euros.
                              It is the Group's policy to hedge certain transactional currency risk
                              associated with sourcing products via foreign exchange contracts.
                              Such hedging measures may have had the effect of increasing costs
                              for the Group to the extent it receives a less advantageous currency
                              exchange rate than the prevailing rate available from time to time.
                              </p>
<p>The Group was exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. The interest
                              rate associated with variable rate financial instruments during the
                              Reporting Period was based on a number of different benchmarks, including
                              EURIBOR, JIBAR and the South African prime rate. The Group is subject
                              to the risk of a material and sustained increase in interest rates
                              set by these benchmarks, which would lead to an increase in the Group's
                              cost of borrowing. An increase in interest rates would therefore have
                              had an adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition
                              or results of operations.
                              </p>
<p>Changes in the Group's creditworthiness affected its ability to
                              meet future liquidity requirements and to retain and access new funding.
                              In the course of its operations, the Group faced liquidity risks arising
                              from potential inabilities to meet contractual obligations on their
                              due dates and fund assets. These obligations were funded through the
                              proceeds of the Group's operations as well as periodic borrowings
                              and funding arrangements, which the Group entered into from time to
                              time. The Group's creditworthiness for new funding arrangements depended
                              on many factors, including its reputation, its gearing position, its
                              cash free cash flow, the retail environment in general, the state
                              of the economy and the level of drawn debt. Certain of these factors
                              were beyond the Group's control. Deterioration in any of these factors
                              could potentially impact the cost and accessibility of new funding
                              or other credit arrangements, thereby having an adverse impact on
                              the Group's business, financial condition or operational results.

                              risk management during the Reporting Period
                              </h4>
<p>The financial risk management of the Group has changed considerably
                              post the Reporting Period. During the Reporting Period, the Group
                              utilised the risk mitigation tools available to manage its financial
                              risks. The Group's financial instruments are listed in the 2017 Consolidated
                              Financial Statements. During 2017, such instruments included forward
                              exchange and currency option contracts. The Group did not speculate
                              in trading derivative or other financial instruments. Financial risks
                              included, but were not limited to, capital risk, liquidity risk, exchange
                              rate risk, market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Financial
                              risks were controlled at operational level with guidance from the
                              Group to ensure optimal risk mitigation.

                              </h4>
<p>The Group's policy in 2017 was to spread debt maturities over a
                              wide range of periods to manage excessive refinancing risk in any
                              one-year period. The Group further managed liquidity risk by monitoring
                              forecasted cash flows and maintaining adequate unused borrowing facilities.
                              In addition, the Group used various sources and instruments to fund
                              its activities in order to reduce any concentration risk and to mitigate
                              liquidity risk.

                              </h4>
<p>The principal objective of the Group's currency risk management
                              and hedging strategy during the Reporting Period remained to mitigate
                              exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates for the currencies
                              the Group is exposed to. It was the Group policy to hedge exposure
                              to operational cash transactions in foreign currencies other than
                              the reporting currency of the underlying operation for a range of
                              forward periods, but not to hedge exposure for the translation of
                              reported profits in the different jurisdictions. In addition, currency
                              assets were hedged by way of currency borrowing where practicable.
                              The responsibility for monitoring and managing these risks was that
                              of operational management, in conjunction with the central treasury
                              and foreign exchange support functions.

<p>During 2017, the Group continued to manage its interest rate exposure
                              by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating interest rates. As part
                              of the process of managing the Group's borrowing mix, the interest

                              borrowings were positioned according to expected movements in interest
                              rates.

<p>Trade accounts receivable and short-term cash investments posed
                              a potential credit risk to the Group. The role of the Group's credit
                              function at operational level is to set consistent standards for assessing,
                              quantifying (scoring), monitoring, mitigating and controlling the
                              credit risk introduced by contractual obligations of trading partners
                              and commercial clients. The granting of credit is controlled at operational
                              level by application procedures and setting account limits. Provision
                              is made for both specific and general bad debts at operational level.
                              In the prevailing economic climate, a high level of attention was
                              paid to analysing the creditworthiness of existing and potential customers.
                              </p>
<p>During the Reporting Period, the Group controlled its cash surpluses
                              and short-term financing through its African, European, USA and Australasian
                              central offices, which invested net cash reserves on the financial
                              markets, mainly in short-term instruments indexed to variable rates.

<p>The events in December 2017 resulted in risks that had previously
                              been rated as well managed proving to be high risk areas that need
                              specific attention to bring them under control.
                              </p>
<p>In this regard the following risks need to be highlighted, in particular
                              the financial risks, loss of leadership, regulatory compliance, damage
                              to reputation and litigation risks. During the Reporting Period, these
                              risks had all been rated as well mitigated and under control. Post
                              the December 2017 announcement each was found to be poorly controlled
                              and the interdependency of these risks increased the impact on the
                              organisation exponentially.
                              </p>
<p>The aforementioned overview of material risks identified during

<p>This section includes those material risks and uncertainties that

                              internal risk management and control systems. Such systems are designed
                              to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve important
                              business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute
                              assurance against material misstatement or loss.

<p>Based on the criteria set out in ISO 31000 and our internal control

                              of the Group's objectives with respect to strategy, operations, financial
                              and compliance matters are described in this section.

<p>The risks described below should be read together with the risks
                              already dealt with above but represent the key risks facing the Management
                              Board arising from the catastrophic events in December 2017. They
                              are not the only risks the Group faces. There may be additional risks
                              of which the Management Board is currently unaware of, or risks that
                              management believes are immaterial or otherwise common to most companies,
                              but which may in the future have a material adverse effect on the
                              Group's financial position, results of operations, liquidity and the

                              systems, procedures and controls were inadequate to support the continued
                              expansion of its operations. The planned growth and synergistic benefits
                              were not delivered upon, and the underlying performance of various
                              subgroups was effectively masked by the accounting irregularities.
                              The Group's future operating results will depend upon the ability
                              of each operating subgroup generating its budgeted results on a standalone
                              basis with no or limited synergistic benefits. The costs to achieve
                              these plans may be greater than anticipated and key suppliers or business
                              partners may choose to change or terminate their relationship with
                              the Group. It is unlikely that the Group will execute any acquisition
                              growth plans and growth will be limited to organic growth with each
                              operating segment. This has had a dramatic impact on the net asset
                              value of the Group as it has been forced to impair substantial intangible
                              assets.
                              </p>
<p>Risk mitigation activities post the Reporting Period:</p>
<p>(i) It is unlikely that the Group will execute any acquisition
                              growth activities in the foreseeable future.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Operating entities that were unlikely to be cash generative
                              in the foreseeable future have been disposed of.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Certain operations require funding to enable them to restructure
                              their operations to become cash generative in the near future. In
                              these instances, the Management Board has engaged with financial creditors
                              and agreed entity specific revised funding arrangements (Mattress
                              Firm and Conforama). Operational management will be held to account
                              to deliver on the revised plans tabled.
                              </p>
<p>(iv) Remaining businesses will be managed on a standalone basis
                              and operational management will be motivated to deliver on the current

<p>The loss of the former CEO and former CFO and certain senior staff
                              has had an impact on the business. This has for the reasons already
                              clearly articulated had a significant impact on investor/lender confidence
                              and disrupted strategic initiatives in the long term. The reputational
                              damage surrounding the Group has impaired the Group's ability to retain
                              talented staff and attract personnel in the short term due to fears
                              arising from the longterm sustainability of the Group. The Group's
                              future success will depend on its ability to manage, attract and retain
                              skilled and qualified personnel. The risk of losing organisational
                              knowledge is high and this places stress on an already limited Group
                              resource. The Group's previous long-term incentive is no longer relevant
                              which creates barriers for motivating existing staff and attracting
                              new staff.

<p>Following the announcement in December 2017, the Group experienced
                              significant reputational damage. This announcement also impacted the

                              on the Group's misfortune. The lack of stability and uncertainty has
                              impacted negatively on supplier and other infrastructural relationships.
                              The reputational damage has in instances made it difficult to recruit
                              senior staff. The Group operates in highly competitive markets and
                              has therefore suffered financially as a result of its damaged reputation.

<p>The Group income is subject to taxation in different jurisdictions

                              of the jurisdictions in which it operates. As a result, the Group

<p>The risk of failure of the supply chain in the form of a loss of
                              supplier confidence or cancellation of contracts has increased significantly
                              for the operations. Several suppliers of raw materials and finished
                              goods have discontinued business with the Group or changed the terms
                              under which they are willing to do business, such as price, minimum
                              quantities, required lead times or payment terms. Fluctuations in
                              the price, availability or quality of (i) the raw materials the Group
                              uses in manufacturing its products or (ii) the products it sources
                              could have a negative effect on the Group's cost of sales and its
                              ability to meet the demands of its customers. In the event of a significant
                              disruption in the Group's supply of raw materials or sourced products,
                              the Group may not be able to locate alternative sources at an acceptable
                              price or in a timely manner. In addition, if the price of raw materials
                              increases, the Group may not be able to pass on to customers all or
                              a portion of the higher costs, due to competitive and market pressures
                              or other reasons.

<p>Risk appetite and tolerance levels drive the risk retention and
                              transfer strategy which is based on the organisation's risk profile
                              and loss history experience. Where possible, predicable risk is retained
                              within divisional operations to ensure the cost of risk transfer is
                              optimal. The Management Board and the Audit and Risk Committee review
                              and considers unpredictable risks identified by management, and defensive
                              strategies are adopted where appropriate. Internal and external risk
                              factors are monitored in order to identify current and emerging risks.
                              </p>
<p>The Group pursues a strategy to mitigate its insurable risks through
                              a combination of self-insurance and commercial insurance coverage.
                              During the Reporting Period a large part of its operations were self-insured
                              through its cell-captive facility. The Group take measures to assess
                              and monitor the financial strength and credit-worthiness of the commercial
                              insurers from which it purchases insurance. The Group however remains
                              exposed to a degree of counterparty credit risk with respect to these
                              insurers.

<p>The current Management Board has prepared a Remediation Plan which
                              contains measures that it believes are appropriate to limit the possible

                              Laws and Regulators in the future. An analysis of the PwC report identified
                              several key areas of focus, including but not limited to non-compliance
                              with laws and regulations, profit creation and asset overstatement,
                              misappropriation of assets and irregular entity support and contributions.
                              This analysis formed a key input into the Remediation Plan. A further
                              phase of investigative work (phase II) has been requested in respect
                              of certain issues identified that the Group envisages will not be

                              taken on termination of the suspension or on removal, the suspension
                              shall end.

                              of the seats shall be held by men and at least 30% by women. With

<p>On the date of this Annual Report, the Management Board consisted

                              diversity, the Group has several female senior executives in its employ
                              who are engaged in a broad spectrum of disciplines and responsibilities.
                              As part of the Group's development initiatives and succession planning,

<p>During the Reporting Period, two out of twelve Supervisory Directors
                              were female (16.67%). However, a further three female Supervisory
                              Directors were nominated by the Supervisory Board and appointed by
                              the General Meeting on 20 April 2018, bringing the number of female
                              Supervisory Directors to five out of eight (62.5%) on the date of
                              this Annual Report. In addition, and in accordance with the objective
                              to strive to nominate Supervisory Directors from the regions where
                              the Group operates and that no nationality should count for more than
                              75% of the Supervisory Directors, the Supervisory Board recently nominated
                              Paul Copley (with British nationality) and David Pauker (with United
                              States nationality) for appointment to the Supervisory Board.
                              </p>
<p>In respect of the nomination of Paul Copley and David Pauker to
                              the Supervisory Board, reference is made to the restructuring of the
                              financial indebtedness of the Company, SEAG and SFHG, to the Lock-Up
                              Agreement, to the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA, as well as the various
                              "restructuring documents" referred to in the CVAs (a number of which
                              the Company is party to) as announced on 19 November 2018 and subsequent
                              announcements.
                              </p>
<p>In accordance with the Lock-Up Agreement, the Nomination Committee
                              has consulted with the creditors' governance working group in relation
                              to the search process and the identification of candidates to be nominated
                              to the Supervisory Board. Following that consultation and search process,
                              the Supervisory Board nominated Paul Copley and David Pauker for appointment
                              to the Supervisory Board.
                              </p>
<p>Provision has also been made in the new finance documents by the
                              Group's European external financial creditors that underscore their
                              support for the appointment of Paul Copley and David Pauker. In particular,
                              pursuant to the terms of the relevant restructuring documents (as
                              mentioned in the CVAs), should the General Meeting not resolve to
                              appoint Paul Copley or David Pauker (or none of them) to the Supervisory
                              Board, the cost of the debt reconstituted pursuant to the restructuring
                              will increase. Specifically: (i) the interest rate applicable to the
                              reconstituted debt of SEAG and SFHG would be increased by 5 per cent.
                              per annum (from between 7.875% and 10.75% PIK per annum (as applicable)
                              to between 12.875% and 15.75% PIK per annum (as applicable)), with
                              such increased interest rates also retrospectively applicable for
                              the period that is specified in each relevant restructuring document;
                              and (ii) the cap on recoveries against the Company will be increased
                              from 5 per cent. per annum to 10 per cent. per annum in respect to
                              the SEAG Contingent Payment Undertaking (as defined in the CVAs),
                              and a cap of 10 per cent. per annum will be instated on recoveries
                              against the Company in respect to the 2021/2022 Contingent Payment
                              Undertaking, the 2023 Contingent Payment Undertaking and the SIHPL

<p>Each Ordinary Share confers the right to cast one vote at a General
                              Meeting, unless and for as long as Preference Shares are in issue,
                              in which case each Ordinary Share confers the right to cast fifty
                              votes and each Preference Share confers the right to cast one vote
                              at a General Meeting. As at the date of this Annual Report, no Preference
                              Shares are outstanding.

<p>Dutch law prescribes a record date to be set twenty-eight days
                              prior to the date of the General Meeting to determine whether a person
                              may attend and exercise the rights relating to the General meeting.
                              Shareholders registered at that date are entitled to attend and exercise
                              their votes.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Distributions</h4>
<p>Distribution of profit shall be made after adoption of the annual
                              financial statements, subject to compliance with Dutch law and the
                              determination of the allocation of profits by the General Meeting,
                              on recommendation by the Management Board and with the approval of
                              the Supervisory Board. The Management Board may resolve, with the
                              approval of the Supervisory Board, that the profit realised during
                              a financial year may be fully or partially appropriated to increase
                              reserves, with the allocation of profit then remaining to be at the
                              disposal of the General Meeting. Proposals for the distribution of
                              profit are shown on the General Meeting agenda as items for separate
                              consideration. At the annual General Meeting of 14 March 2017, shareholders
                              approved a final dividend of €0.03 per Ordinary Share, payable on
                              20 March 2017. An interim dividend of €0.12 was paid to Shareholders
                              on 6 December 2016 in respect of the twelvemonth period ended 30 June
                              2016.
                              </p>
<p>Dividends on Preference Shares, as and when such Shares are issued,
                              will be paid in accordance with the relevant provisions contained
                              in the Articles.

<p>Under the Articles, and with due observance of Dutch law, Shares
                              may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the General Meeting or of
                              the Management Board, if and insofar the Management Board has been
                              designated for that purpose pursuant to a resolution of the General
                              Meeting for a fixed period (this period may not exceed five years).
                              A resolution by the General Meeting to issue Shares or to designate
                              the Management Board as the body of the Company authorised to issue
                              Shares may only be taken at the proposal of the Management Board,
                              which proposal requires the approval of the Supervisory Board. On
                              such designation, the number of Shares of each class which may be
                              issued must be specified. The designation may be extended, each time
                              for a period not exceeding five years. Unless the designation provides
                              otherwise, it may not be withdrawn. The authority of the General Meeting
                              to issue Shares shall be without prejudice to the authority of the
                              Management Board to determine, with the approval of the Supervisory
                              Board, the percentage of premium per Preference Share. The same applies
                              by analogy to the granting of rights to subscribe for Shares, but
                              does not apply to the issuance of Shares to a person exercising a
                              right to subscribe for Shares previously granted.
                              </p>
<p>Prior to (and in anticipation of) the Company's listing on FSE,
                              in December 2015, certain authorisations were granted to the Management
                              Board, details of which rights to issue Shares, to grant rights to
                              subscribe for Shares and to limit or exclude pre-emption rights in
                              relation thereto are contained in the prospectus to shareholders dated
                              19 November 2015 (available on the Company's website at www.steinhoffinternational.com).
                              </p>
<p>At the General Meeting held on 14 March 2017, without prejudice
                              to any of the other authorisations previously granted to the Management
                              Board by the General Meeting, as referred to above, the General Meeting
                              granted the Management Board the authority to issue Ordinary Shares
                              and to grant rights to subscribe for Ordinary Shares: i) up to 10%
                              of the total nominal issued share capital of the Company as at 14
                              March 2017 for all purposes including the granting of stock options,
                              the financing of mergers and acquisitions and the issue of new convertible
                              bonds; plus (ii) issue up to an additional 10% of the total nominal
                              issued share capital of the Company as at 14 March 2017 to be used
                              only in connection with or on the occasion of mergers and acquisitions
                              and strategic alliances.
                              </p>
<p>Each of the foregoing authorisations were valid for a period of
                              up to eighteen months from 14 March 2017. If the Share Issue Authorisations
                              were used during this eighteen month period, then the Management Board,
                              subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shall propose to
                              the General Meeting that the authorities granted be restored back
                              to up to the 10% level for each of the approved purposes, as set out
                              above.
                              </p>
<p>The authorities granted by the General Meeting enabled the Company
                              to comply with its obligations to issue Ordinary Shares and grant
                              rights under the Group's various share incentive schemes and afforded
                              the Management Board the flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities
                              such as mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships. The General
                              Meeting on 14 March 2017 also authorised the Management Board, in
                              accordance with article 2:96a, paragraph 6 of the Dutch Civil Code,
                              to limit or exclude any pre-emption rights in relation to the issue
                              of Ordinary Shares or the granting of rights to subscribe for Ordinary
                              Shares; such authority being limited to the number of Shares authorised
                              under the Share Issue Authorisations and to the 18 month period from
                              14 March 2017.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, in accordance with article 2:98, paragraph 4 of the
                              Dutch Civil Code, the General Meeting authorised the Management Board,
                              for a period of eighteen months from 14 March 2017, to acquire fully
                              paid-up Shares in the capital of the Company. Under this authority,
                              Shares could be acquired at the stock exchange or otherwise, at a
                              price per Ordinary Share between nominal value and 110% of the opening
                              price on the FSE at the date of the acquisition, up to 20% of the
                              issued share capital at the date of acquisition.
                              </p>
<p>This authority, which replaced the authority to acquire Shares
                              previously granted to the Management Board on 1 December 2015, afforded
                              the Management Board the flexibility to repurchase Shares in the Company,
                              to service share options granted or to cover obligations under share-based
                              compensation plans or for other purposes. After the Reporting Date,
                              the Company repurchased 70.6 million Ordinary Shares, representing
                              1.7% of its issued share capital. The Ordinary Shares acquired by
                              the Company, or held by Subsidiaries, are being treated as treasury
                              shares and the number of voting interests was accordingly reduced
                              to 4.214.585.580 at the Reporting Date.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">DCGC compliance</h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Introduction</h4>
<p>During the Reporting Period, the Company was required to comply
                              with the 2008 Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the "DCGC"). Pursuant
                              to the DCGC, deviations from the DCGC require explanation in accordance
                              with the DCGC's 'comply or explain' principle. On 7 September 2017,
                              the legislative proposal containing the relevant implementation resolutions
                              for the enactment of the final version of the revised DCGC (the "Revised
                              DCGC"), as presented by the Dutch Corporate Governance Code Monitoring
                              Committee on 8 December 2016, was adopted by the Dutch government.
                              The Revised DCGC applies for financial years commencing on or after
                              1 January 2017. As a consequence, the Revised DCGC only applies to
                              the Company with effect from 1 October 2017 and the Company will report
                              on its compliance with the Revised DCGC in its Annual Report for the
                              2018 Reporting Period.

<p>During the Reporting Period, the Company was compliant with the
                              relevant principles and best practice provisions of the DCGC, with
                              the exception of the following:

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">II.1.5.</h4>
<p>This best practice provision provides that as regards financial
                              reporting risks the Management Board states in the annual report that
                              the internal risk management and control systems provide a reasonable
                              assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any errors
                              of material importance and that the risk management and control systems
                              worked properly in the year under review. The Management Board shall
                              provide clear substantiation of this.
                              </p>
<p>In deviation of this best practice provision, the Management Board
                              are of the view that they are not in a position to state that the
                              internal risk management and control systems provided reasonable assurance
                              that the financial reporting did not contain any errors of material
                              importance and that the control systems worked properly during the
                              Reporting Period. This is evidenced by the accounting irregularities
                              that occurred. The Management Board is however of the opinion that
                              the process that has been followed, subsequent to the announcement
                              of 5 December 2017, has provided reasonable assurance that the 2017
                              Consolidated Financial Statements, do not contain any errors of material
                              importance. The Management Board has designed the Remediation Plan,
                              which includes measures aimed at ensuring that the risk management
                              and control systems are effective going forward. The Remediation Plan
                              is being implemented at present.

<p>In deviation of this best practice provision, during the Reporting
                              Period, several former Managing Directors and several other former
                              Senior Managers acquired a property in Portugal from Conforama, a
                              Subsidiary of the Company, in order to enable these Managing Directors
                              and Senior Managers to obtain so-called golden visas for themselves
                              and their families (the "Portuguese Real Estate Transaction"). Conforama
                              received sale proceeds in the amount of €7 million. This value approximates
                              the net book value of the property on the date of the sale. The price
                              was determined by consulting with external valuation experts and is
                              deemed to be market related. Following completion of the transaction,
                              Conforama entered into a rental agreement with the new owners. The
                              rental is considered to be below market for the benefit of Conforama.

<p>Best practice provision III.2.1 provides that all Supervisory Board

                              independent within the meaning of the DCGC.
                              </p>
<p>During the Reporting Period, nine of the twelve Supervisory Directors
                              qualified as independent within the meaning of the DCGC. However,
                              the remaining non-independent Supervisory Directors (Christo Wiese,
                              Jacob Wiese and Thierry Guibert), through their wider association
                              with the Group and its operations over the years, brought experience
                              and an informed dimension and continuity to Supervisory Board deliberations.
                              This was of particular importance given the diversity and geographical
                              spread of the Group's operations. The majority of the Supervisory
                              Directors, however, satisfied the independence criteria of the DCGC.
                              To strengthen the independence of the Supervisory Board, which was
                              chaired by Christo Wiese, who classified as a nonindependent Supervisory
                              Director within the meaning of the DCGC, Len Konar, independent Supervisory
                              Director and Deputy Chairman, was appointed as lead independent director.
                              His role as Deputy Chairman and lead independent director was to serve
                              as a sounding board for the chairman, to act, if necessary, as an
                              intermediary between the chairman and other Supervisory Directors,
                              to deal with any shareholders' concerns where contact through normal
                              channels had failed to resolve concerns, or where such contact may
                              be inappropriate, to chair discussions and decision-making by the
                              Supervisory Board on matters where the chairman had a conflict of
                              interest and to lead the performance appraisal of the chairman. As
                              a consequence of this deviation, the Report of the Supervisory Board
                              does not state that best practice provision III.2.1 has been fulfilled
                              as provided by best practice provision III.2.3. On 14 December 2017,
                              both Christo Wiese and Jacob Wiese resigned from the Supervisory Board
                              and on 2 February 2018, Thierry Guibert resigned from the Supervisory

                              divisions and/or subsidiaries is reported directly to it and that
                              the integrity of the information is not compromised. The Supervisory

<p>During the Reporting Period, inter alia the former chairman Christo

<p>As a result, the concentration of ownership among the Voting Pool
                              Parties during the Reporting Period could have (i) deterred a third
                              party from making a takeover offer for the Company and thereby have

                              Company and (ii) affected the market price and liquidity of the Ordinary

                              of the Audit and Risk Committee from September through December 2017
                              </h4>
<p>The former CEO received a letter from the External Auditor (with
                              a copy the chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee) dated 15 September
                              2017 that reports of accounting irregularities had come to their attention
                              through the media and was furthermore based on information received
                              on 14 September 2017 in connection with the Enterprise Chamber proceedings
                              initiated by Seifert. The chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee
                              then called a special meeting to discuss the letter. At the special
                              meeting, the Managing Directors stated that the allegations were untrue
                              and that they would be cooperating to clear the issue. In the days
                              and weeks that followed the meeting, the Audit and Risk Committee
                              and its members had various meetings with and without members of the
                              Management Board, advisers to the Company, and with the External Auditor
                              in order to gain insight on whether the allegations of accounting
                              irregularities were valid. The Audit and Risk Committee was informed
                              by the CEO that he needed time to assemble information and supporting
                              documentation in order to provide answers and evidence to the External
                              Auditor's queries. This culminated in a further special meeting of
                              the Audit and Risk Committee on 20 November 2017, with the External
                              Auditor and Company advisers present, to discuss the External Auditor's
                              concerns and the advisers' response that they had not found any evidence
                              that would cause them to conclude that accounting irregularities had
                              taken place and that, as such, the External Auditor's concerns were
                              unwarranted. In light of the issues raised by the External Auditor,
                              the Audit and Risk Committee members attend the European audit close-out
                              meeting. In the week following that meeting, a meeting was held on
                              29 November 2017 between the chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee,
                              the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the External Auditor to
                              discuss the audit and the issues raised by the External Auditor, including
                              the validity and recoverability of certain assets.
                              </p>
<p>On 30 November 2017, the External Auditor again informed the chairman
                              of the Supervisory Board that it still required a forensic investigation
                              into the suspected accounting irregularities. The former CEO advised
                              that he would obtain the audit evidence that would refute the allegations
                              of irregularities and would present the same at the scheduled meeting
                              of the Audit and Risk Committee on 4 December 2017. At a special meeting
                              on 3 December 2017, the Supervisory Board discussed a draft ad-hoc
                              announcement concerning the publication of unaudited financial statements
                              and delegated finalisation of the same to as special committee. The
                              former CEO did not appear at the scheduled meeting of the Audit and
                              Risk Committee on 4 December 2017 and in the evening of 4 December,
                              through one of his legal representatives, he offered his resignation.

                              was formed to identify and address any challenges encountered in the
                              preparation and audit of these financial statements. The sub-committee

                              with particular emphasis on the restatements and areas where judgement
                              was required.
                              </p>

<h4 class="z_titel">REMUNERATION REPORT</h4>
<p>Our remuneration philosophy dictates that all employees are fairly
                              rewarded for their individual and joint contributions in the execution
                              of the Steinhoff business strategy and delivery of the group's operating
                              and financial performance. Steinhoff 's remuneration philosophy is
                              to remunerate all employees in a competitive manner to attract, motivate
                              and retain individuals of the necessary calibre.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Key principles
                              and remuneration elements
                              </h4>
<p>The Group is an international business with revenue earned in many
                              countries and expects its Senior Management to be internationally
                              mobile and to have knowledge and experience across borders. As a result,
                              the Group competes for skills and talent in a global marketplace and
                              its approach to remuneration needs to be flexible and competitive
                              in all countries it operates in.
                              </p>
<p>The objective of the Remuneration Policy is therefore to provide
                              remuneration in a form which will attract, retain and motivate Senior
                              Management, while protecting and promoting the objectives of the Group.
                              The Remuneration Policy caters for a variable component, which is
                              linked to pre-determined, assessable and influenceable targets aligned
                              to the company strategy. The variable components are predominantly
                              structured to incentivise Senior Management throughout the business
                              cycle but drive the long-term sustainability of the business, in keeping
                              with its risk profile.
                              </p>
<p>The Remuneration Policy is based on the following five key principles:</p>
<p>(i) To pay fairly and competitively relative to the specific industry
                              and market in support of the business strategy.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) To attract and retain key and critical skills at the required
                              level.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) To pay for performance; where incentivebased awards are paid
                              for achieving demanding performance targets over the short, medium
                              and long term.
                              </p>
<p>(iv) To ensure that incentive plans, performance measures and targets
                              are structured to operate effectively throughout the business seasonal
                              cycle.
                              </p>
<p>(v) To ensure, by regular review, that the design of long term
                              incentives is prudent, aligned with the corporate strategy aimed at
                              achieving long term goals and at the same time does not expose stakeholders
                              to a position where the sustainability of the Group is placed at risk.
                              </p>
<p>In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Supervisory Board seeks
                              to ensure an appropriate balance between the fixed, variable and performance-related
                              elements of the remuneration of the Senior Management. The Supervisory
                              Board also seek to ensure an appropriate balance between those aspects
                              of the package linked to short-term financial performance and those
                              linked to longer-term sustainable stakeholder value creation.
                              </p>
<p>The four elements of remuneration consist of a base salary, annual
                              bonus, LTI's, and benefits. The Supervisory Board has the discretionary
                              power to adjust any variable remuneration component rewarded to a
                              Senior Manager, with respect to a previous financial year, if the
                              Supervisory Board feels that the outcome is unreasonable due to exceptional
                              circumstances during the relevant performance period. In addition,
                              the Supervisory Board shall have the right to recover any bonus awarded
                              to a Senior Manager on the basis of incorrect information on whether
                              or not the financial performance targets or other qualifying criteria
                              have been met or other circumstances the bonus was dependent on.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Base salary</h4>
<p>The fixed element of remuneration is referred to as the base salary.
                              Its purpose is to provide a competitive level of remuneration. In
                              determining base salaries, the Supervisory Board takes into consideration
                              the Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities,
                              and in addition the Supervisory Board will take into account the impact
                              of the base salary on the pay differentials within the Company. The
                              Supervisory Board determines an appropriate level for the base salary
                              with the aid of external reference data issued by independent remuneration
                              experts.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Annual bonus</h4>
<p>Senior Managers are entitled to an annual performance related bonus
                              payment. The objective of the annual performance related bonus is
                              to incentivise and reward strong short term financial and personal
                              performance, the implementation of strategic initiatives, such as
                              meeting growth targets, while continuing to be focused on sustainable
                              results which are aligned with the long term strategy of the Group.
                              The Remuneration Policy requires the Supervisory Board to set performance
                              conditions on an individual basis on or before the beginning of the
                              relevant financial year. The annual bonus is based on a percentage
                              of the annual base salary.
                              </p>
<p>The financial, operational and transformation targets, represent
                              in excess of 80% of the potential annual bonus. Where performance
                              criteria are supplemented by personal performance objectives, such
                              personal performance objectives represent on average less than 20%
                              of the potential bonus that can be achieved.
                              </p>
<p>The Supervisory Board has the discretion to defer all or part of
                              the annual bonus payment to Senior Managers on terms to be agreed
                              on an annual basis, dependent on the performance criteria applicable
                              to such bonuses and the longer-term measurement that could be implied
                              by such performance criteria.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">LTI's</h4>
<p>The Senior Managers participate in the ESRS, which was approved
                              by the shareholders of the Company's legal predecessor during its
                              annual General Meeting of 6 December 2010 and amended and adopted
                              during the General Meeting of 1 December 2015.
                              </p>
<p>The allocation of LTl's is based on the following key eligibility
                              criteria: individuals who are key to driving the Group's longterm
                              business strategy; retention of key talent/scarce skills; and talent
                              management strategy and succession plans.
                              </p>
<p>The allocation of LTl's is based on the following key eligibility
                              criteria: individuals who are key to driving the group's long-term
                              business strategy; retention of key talent/ scarce skills; and talent

                              </p>
<p>The Remuneration Policy provides that the targets for LTl's are
                              set with reference to industry and market benchmark performance. Such
                              benchmarks are determined annually by measuring operational performance
                              against those of peer group companies (in comparable industries and
                              markets) in local currencies.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Benefits</h4>
<p>Benefits include membership of retirement funds and medical aid
                              schemes, to which contributions are made by a Senior Manager and the
                              relevant Group Company where the Senior Manager is employed. In addition,
                              the Senior Managers are entitled to expense allowances required for
                              the proper performance of their duties. The contracts with Senior
                              Managers do not contain any 'golden parachute' provisions.
                              </p>
<p>The individual may elect how much the retirement savings portion
                              should be and the relevant contributions, based on his election, are
                              paid by the individual. Depending on the terms of the particular medical
                              aid schemes, the member can elect the level of medical cover of their
                              choice and the same is paid by the individual. Due to the individual
                              choices in the level of retirement and medical benefits, the Company
                              has no liability in this regard.

<p>During the Reporting Period, the Human Resources and Remuneration
                              Committee compared the Management Board's performance to their targets,
                              based on the audited 2016 Annual Financial Statements. The outcome
                              of the review was an approval by the Supervisory Board of an increase
                              of the base of 13.6% for both the CEO and the COO, and an increase
                              of 17.6% for the CFO.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">General</h4>
<p>During the Reporting Period, the Supervisory Board, on the recommendation
                              of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, after determining
                              that the performance criteria were met, approved the annual bonus
                              for the Managing Directors and other Senior Managers. In addition,
                              strategic project bonuses were awarded to the Managing Directors and
                              other Senior Managers for their work on specific strategic projects
                              such as the listing of Pepkor on the JSE. The payment of these bonuses

                              and performance, were properly reviewed and accounted for both retrospectively
                              at the end of a financial period and prospectively for future financial
                              periods.

<p>Both the current Management Board and Supervisory Board confirm
                              their respective commitment to make use of their clawback rights where

                              or the Management Board (in respect of senior employees). Share rights
                              are granted to qualifying participants on an annual basis. Such share
                              rights vest on the third anniversary of the allocation date, provided

                              </p>
<p>The performance criteria set by the Management Board for share
                              rights granted to senior employees took into account targets relating
                              to growth, cash generation, returns and sustainability of the relevant
                              employer companies and the Group. The Supervisory Board set performance
                              criteria for the Managing Directors and other Senior Managers with
                              reference to industry and market benchmark performance. The benchmark
                              was determined by measuring the operational performance against those
                              of peer group companies in comparable industries and markets. The
                              peer group consisted of: Metro AG, Inditex SA, Kingfisher Plc, Carrefour
                              SA, Adidas AG, Volkswagen Group AG, GrandVision N.V., Royal Bam N.V.,
                              Bidvest Group Ltd, Shoprite Holdings Ltd and Woolworths Ltd.
                              </p>
<p>The performance criteria for the Managing Directors and other Senior
                              Managers were aligned with the following long-term strategic objectives
                              of the Group:
                              </p>
<p>(i) Integrated retail: to create a solid European and African footprint
                              of household and apparel goods businesses; to develop those brands
                              that outperform local competitors; sustainably raise the operating
                              margins; leverage of the Group's global scale and knowledge; exert
                              sufficient influence over the entire supply chain; having due regard
                              for long term sustainability of the business of the Group, its environment
                              and social impact and governance matters.
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Other Investments: to exert influence on the Group's associate
                              and other investments to manage appropriate returns on investments
                              and long term sustainability.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Vesting of
                              2013 financial year grant
                              </h4>
<p>Under the ESRS, 14.837.420 share rights were granted to a total
                              of 77 participants during the Reporting Period. These share rights
                              were subject to certain vesting conditions being met. Following the
                              recommendations made by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee
                              the Supervisory Board determined that these vesting conditions had
                              been met. This resulted in the vesting of 14.366.887 share rights.
                              </p>
<p>In terms of the Supervisory Board's discretion on vesting conditions
                              under the Scheme with respect to Managing Directors and other Senior
                              Managers, the following conditions were taken into account in determining
                              the vesting of the grant:
                              </p>
<p>(i) Growth: the Supervisory Board concluded that growth in headline
                              earnings per Share would be an appropriate measure of growth. The
                              calculation of the headline earnings per Share was determined in terms
                              of JSE listing requirements and was subject to external assurance
                              by way of the annual external audit of the Group's financial statements.
                              It was determined that Steinhoff's growth in headline earnings per
                              Share should outperform, cumulatively over the relevant three-year
                              measurement criteria, those of peer group of companies in comparable
                              industries and markets. .
                              </p>
<p>(ii) Cash generation: in accordance with the Remuneration Policy,
                              at least 80% of operating profit cumulatively over the relevant three-year
                              measurement criteria should be generated in cash, as measured by cash
                              generated from operations as a percentage of operating profit.
                              </p>
<p>(iii) Returns: an appropriate returns-based criterion remained
                              challenging for the Group as a result of the geographic diversity
                              of operations and the inherent currency and other volatilities. In
                              response to this, a blended and weighted targeted return on equity
                              was recommended by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee
                              and approved by the Supervisory Board. A minimum return of 7% needed
                              to be achieved by operations in developed markets and 15% by emerging
                              market operations over the vesting period. The return on equity was
                              calculated as headline earnings based on average shareholders' equity
                              and is adjusted for currency fluctuations.
                              </p>
<p>(v) Qualification for annual bonus: in addition to the above-mentioned
                              group performance criteria, share scheme participants must have qualified
                              for participation in their respective divisions' annual incentive
                              bonus schemes, which include meeting their respective key performance
                              indicators. This requirement is evaluated and applied by the Human
                              Resources and Remuneration Committee on an individual basis. As a
                              result of the Group satisfying vesting conditions, as outlined in
                              (i) through (iii) above, the 2013 financial year share allocation
                              vested subject to the fourth vesting condition which was evaluated
                              on an individual basis.
                              </p>
<p>Based on the rules of the ESRS, vesting can only occur at 0% or
                              100%, subject to the participant maintaining a minimum shareholding
                              in the Company.

                              Steinhoff N.V. for the period ended 30 September 2017 comprise the
                              Group and the Group's interest in equity accounted companies. The
                              Group is primarily involved in the retailing of general merchandise,

                              </p>
<p>On 5 December 2017, Steinhoff announced that its 2017 consolidated
                              financial statements could not be released when expected as its external
                              auditor, Deloitte, had identified potential accounting irregularities
                              and questionable transactions. As a result of these concerns, PwC
                              was upon the instructions of the Supervisory Board, retained by the
                              Group's legal advisors to conduct an independent forensic investigation
                              (the "Investigation"). The audited 2016 consolidated financial statements
                              were withdrawn and publication of the 2017 consolidated financial
                              statements was postponed. Pursuant to the investigation a report ("the

<p>In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the 2017
                              Consolidated Financial Statements, the Management Board is required
                              to consider whether the Group and Company can continue in operational
                              existence for the foreseeable future.
                              </p>
<p>The Group and Company's cash flow forecast indicate that both the
                              Group and the Company can, based on certain critical assumptions,
                              continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, namely
                              for 12 months after the date of authorisation.
                              </p>
<p>The Management Board draw attention to the following critical assumptions
                              that are key in arriving at the cash flows, namely:
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Litigation</h4>
<p>The Group and Company has received several shareholder and vendor
                              claims and notices of regulatory investigation. A key assumption in
                              both the Group and Company cash flows is that no material claims or
                              fines are awarded against the Group or Company and will become payable
                              during the next twelve months. As stated previously, these legal proceedings
                              and regulatory investigations have been initiated against the Group
                              and Company during the past seventeen months. The Supervisory Board
                              and the Management Board, assisted by a newly constituted litigation
                              committee, and in consultation with the Group's attorneys, continue
                              to assess the merits of, and responses to, these claims, and provide
                              feedback to the regulatory bodies. Several initial defences have already
                              been filed by Steinhoff in these legal proceedings. However, litigation
                              remains a material uncertainty as to its ultimate impact on the liquidity
                              of the Group.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Tax</h4>
<p>Tax remains a material uncertainty as the tax impact of the accounting
                              irregularities identified and the consequential effects thereof remains
                              uncertain. This is exacerbated by the fact that these irregularities
                              impact multiple jurisdictions, the finalisation of which will require
                              substantial analysis and negotiation with various Tax Authorities
                              in the respective jurisdictions. A key assumption is therefore that
                              the tax assumptions built into the current cash forecast, for both
                              the Group and Company, continue to apply and that no unexpected material
                              assessments are received.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">CVA process</h4>
<p>The restructuring of the Group's existing financial indebtedness
                              continues. The full implementation of the CVA is critical to the liquidity
                              of the Group. Should the implementation of the CVA fail for any reason,
                              this would have a materially negative impact on the liquidity of the
                              Group and the Company.
                              </p>

                              Arrangements
                              </h4>
<p>That there is no event of default in the future, once the CVA has
                              been fully implemented or under the existing agreement with the Hemisphere
                              lenders, that threatens the current standstill agreements.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Management Board draws attention to the following facts:</p>
<table cellpadding="0mm" class="list_table_ul">
<tr>
<td class="list_ident">―</td>
<td class="list_content">
<p class="list_p_fl">that in both the Group and Company's financial statements
                              current liabilities exceed current assets, and
                              </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="list_ident">―</td>
<td class="list_content">
<p class="list_p_fl">that these material uncertainties extend beyond the foreseeable
                              future.
                              </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>These facts therefore cast significant doubt upon the Company and
                              Group's ability to continue as a going concern beyond the foreseeable
                              future. If the Group and Company is to continue as a going concern,
                              the Management Board and operational management require sufficient
                              time to stabilise the Group and re-establish value at operational
                              level. This will enable the Group and Company to realise assets in
                              a non-distressed fashion and thus maximise value to repay or reduce
                              debt to manageable levels. This will also maximise the return to all
                              stakeholders. At the same time a solution for the potential litigation
                              will need to be sought and implemented.

<p>The recoverability of loans and assets with counterparties have
                              been assessed and where they have been alleged to have entered into

                              in the entity with the liability or where the Group does not have
                              sufficient information to perform a recoverability test, management
                              has deemed it appropriate to impair these assets. Refer to note 1.2.3,
                              note 11 and note 30.

<p>The determination of the amount and timing of the impairment losses
                              necessitate a number of judgements and estimates. These include determination
                              of value-in-use calculations based on revised information and selection
                              of the appropriate discount rate given the significantly changed risk
                              profile. Only where impairment tests were required to be done or there
                              was a clear indication of an impairment indicator, were impairment
                              losses included as a prior period error. Management has also deemed
                              it appropriate to impair loans if there is no security on such loans.

<p>Management had to apply judgment in respect of certain share funding
                              transactions where the terms did not stipulate that the funding was
                              with recourse only to the shares. In these cases, management has considered
                              the substance of the arrangements and deemed it appropriate to treat
                              such funding as only having recourse to the shares, since it was provided
                              specifically for the purchase of shares. In certain instances only
                              proceeds from the sale of shares were used to settle such loans and
                              the only significant asset held by the debtor was the shares. The
                              transactions are treated as in-subtances options in respect of the
                              Steinhoff's shares, in some cases triggering a share-based payment
                              expense. Measuring the share-based payment involved a number of estimates
                              and judgements in respect of both the classification as cash or equity
                              settled and the determination of the inputs of the valuation model.

<p>In certain instances a number of share funding transactions occurred
                              with a specific party. Management has considered each advance of funds
                              separately. Where the financing related to a specific advance has
                              been repaid management has concluded that the in-substance option
                              has been settled and the shares are released and no longer treated
                              as treasury shares. Management has assumed that repayment takes place
                              of the earliest advance first.

                              accounting for business combination
                              </h4>
<p>These adjustments were done as a result of changes in the business
                              combinations within the measurement period of one year.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2016</h4>
<p>In the prior period, the accounting for the business combinations
                              of Mattress Firm and Poundland was prepared using provisional amounts
                              as allowed in terms of IFRS 3 due to the September 2016 effective
                              date of both acquisitions. The restatement of the statement of financial
                              position as at 30 September 2016 resulted from retrospective adjustments
                              to the previous initial accounting in light of the updated information
                              relating to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities
                              as measured at the date of acquisition. The adjustments to the provisional
                              amounts are recognised as if the accounting for the business combination
                              had been completed at the acquisition date. These restatements are
                              not as a result of the prior period errors.
                              </p>
<p>The post-combination accounting of these acquisitions was finalised
                              and the affected assets and liabilities were retrospectively restated
                              at 30 September 2016 for:

<p>On 5 December 2017, Steinhoff announced that its 2017 consolidated
                              financial statements could not be released when expected as its external
                              auditor, Deloitte, had identified potential accounting irregularities
                              and questionable transactions.
                              </p>
<p>As a result of these concerns, PwC was upon the instruction of
                              the Supervisory Board, retained by the Group's legal advisors to conduct
                              an independent forensic investigation. The audited 2016 consolidated
                              financial statements were withdrawn and publication of the 2017 consolidated
                              financial statements was postponed.
                              </p>
<p>The Investigation Report was produced on 11 March 2019. The investigation
                              is ongoing. The Investigation Report is confidential and legal professional
                              privilege inheres therein. Consequently, the Investigation Report

<p>Management determined that certain other transactions, which were

<p>Management identified a number of transactions with four principal

                              length basis. The four principal groups are: Campion and/or Fulcrum
                              Group, Talgarth Group, TG and/or TG Management Group and Fihag Group
                              and certain individuals; Schmidt, Evans, Pasquier were purportedly
                              independent, but were in substance closely related and/or controlled

<p>Management have considered the nature and substance of the Group's
                              relationships with these respective parties. Management have considered
                              whether Schmidt, Evans and Pasquier were related parties and have
                              considered whether they controlled entities in the principal groups

<p>The transactions entered into between the Group and entities within
                              the Campion Group and Talgarth Group included, amongst others, the
                              facilitation of business acquisitions and transactions that involved
                              the trading of Steinhoff shares. Funding in respect of such transactions
                              was mostly provided for by the Group. It appears that all or the majority
                              of these transactions were concluded on a non-arm's length basis.
                              Management considered whether the Group controls the Campion Group,
                              Talgarth Group, TG Group and Fihag Group. Certain of the Group's former
                              executives and other non-Steinhoff executives, who have subsequently
                              resigned, were assessed to have a degree of influence over the structure
                              of the entities and the outcome of these transactions and the Group
                              is exposed to variable returns resulting from the recoverability of
                              the funding provided and the manner in which the transactions were
                              structured for the benefit of the Group. However, although there are
                              some indicators suggesting that Steinhoff might control the Talgarth,
                              Campion, TG and Fihag Groups, no conclusive information exists to
                              confirm that Steinhoff does in fact control any of these Groups. In
                              addition, management does not have access to the financial information
                              of either the Talgarth, Campion, TG or Fihag Groups to be able to
                              consolidate these entities. Management therefore accounted for the
                              transactions with the respective entities on a transaction by transaction
                              basis to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions and
                              the Group's exposure. The Group did not identify any direct transactions
                              with Fihag or direct loans outstanding during the period from 1 July
                              2015. Where transactions were entered into within specific entities
                              in the respective groups it was considered whether the Group controlled
                              the specific entity it was transacting with, which has led to the
                              consolidation of certain entities within those groups. The recoverability
                              of any loans and assets with such counterparties has been assessed
                              and where there is no security on the loans in the entity with the
                              liability or where the Group does not have sufficient information
                              to perform a recoverability test, management has deemed it appropriate
                              to impair these assets.
                              </p>
<p>Management have also considered their relationship with the following
                              individuals: Schmidt, Evans, Pasquier:
                              </p>
<p>Schmidt was the financial director of the European division of
                              the Company until his resignation on 28 November 2011. Despite his
                              resignation, shares allocated to him continued to vest in respect
                              of the Steinhoff share scheme for the 2013 and 2014 financial years.
                              Since resigning from the Group, Schmidt was not a director or key
                              management personnel of the Group and did not have a relationship
                              with the Group that would indicate the legal form of a related party
                              in terms of IAS 24 Related Parties ("IAS 24").
                              </p>
<p>Evans and Pasquier have never been key management personnel of
                              the Group and there are no legal relationships that indicate that
                              they are related parties in terms of IAS 24.
                              </p>
<p>The 2016 consolidated financial statements and its statement of
                              financial position as at 1 July 2015 have been restated to correct
                              prior period errors. As a result of the extent and complexity of the
                              restatements required to correct these errors, management has grouped
                              the restated transactions according to type and impact on the consolidated
                              financial statements. A brief explanation of each grouping is discussed
                              below with the detail of the restatements contained in this note and
                              the relevant section of the consolidated financial statements.

                              of restatements:
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1. Property
                              transactions
                              </h4>
<p>Property should be recognised at depreciated cost, where cost is
                              measured at the date on which the Group acquires the property either
                              through acquisition or through gaining control of the entity owning
                              the property. The carrying value of the property should not be affected
                              if properties are transferred between Group entities. Information
                              that is now available has been used to reassess the control of entities
                              owning properties and the substance of property related transactions.
                              A number of transactions in which properties were transferred between
                              entities are now considered internal to the Group and therefore should
                              not have impacted the consolidated financial statements. This has
                              resulted in the reversal of some significant step ups in the cost
                              of properties.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">2. Intangible
                              asset transactions
                              </h4>
<p>There are strict requirements under IFRS in relation to the recognition
                              of internally generated intangibles as assets. In the past, the Group
                              purportedly sold internally generated intangible assets (or entities
                              owning these assets) to so called independent parties, which were
                              then reacquired resulting in the recognition of the internally generated
                              intangible as a purchased intangible measured at fair value. In certain
                              instances the sale and repurchase of certain intangible assets acquired
                              from third parties were also stepped up. As a result profit and assets
                              were overstated, since the risks and rewards of ownership of the intangible
                              assets always remained within the Group.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">3. Accounting
                              for Group or related entities
                              </h4>
<p>The appropriate recognition of investments in consolidated financial
                              statements depends on the nature of the holding. Controlled entities
                              should be consolidated, jointly controlled entities should be equity
                              accounted on the same basis as entities over which the investor has
                              significant influence, with all other investments being recognised
                              at fair value. Where investments are recognised at fair value, adjustments
                              to fair value may only be recognised in profit or loss if specific
                              criteria are satisfied, failing which they are recognised in other
                              comprehensive income. The determination of the correct accounting
                              treatment is therefore dependent on correctly understanding the relationship
                              between the two entities as there are many other factors, in addition
                              to the size of the shareholding, that are relevant. As a result of
                              new information emerging relating to loan financing, previously undisclosed
                              agreements, and more insight into the way in which decisions relating
                              to the investments were made, management has revised its assessment
                              of the appropriate method of recognising some of its investments.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">4. Contributions
                              and 'cash equivalents'
                              </h4>
<p>Any contributions received from independent third parties in relation
                              to trading activities should be recognised either as income or as
                              a reduction in expenses, with a receivable recognised to the extent
                              that payment has not been received at the time of the transaction.
                              The Group previously recognised certain contributions arising from
                              the so-called sale of Knowhow and supplier volume rebates that lacked
                              economic substance and did not result in cash flows in to the Group,
                              which in turn resulted in an overstatement of profit. A restatement
                              is therefore required to reverse the aforementioned contributions
                              recognised in profit together with the related debit, which in some
                              cases had been incorrectly classified as "cash and cash equivalents"
                              instead of a receivable.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">5. Share transactions</h4>
<p>Where the acquisition of Steinhoff shares is funded by loan finance
                              from the Group that has no recourse to any asset other than those
                              shares, the borrower does not carry the risk of a decline in the share
                              price but will benefit from any increase in the share price above
                              the loan balance. The borrower's exposure is therefore effectively
                              the same as a purchased call option on the shares. The substance is
                              therefore that the funded shares are only treated as issued share
                              capital once the related loan financing has been settled. Any shares
                              that are issued prior to the settlement of the loan are therefore
                              reflected as treasury shares i.e. as a debit to equity. The optionality
                              granted to the borrower is in substance an equity settled share-based
                              payment, which results in an IFRS 2 related expense.

                              </h4>
<p>The restatements as a result of the accounting irregularities has
                              consequential impacts on various other assets and liabilities of the
                              Group. The most material impacts related to; the impairment of goodwill
                              and brands due to the revision of inputs used in value-in-use calculations
                              of CGUs as a result of incorrect forecast information and revised
                              WACC rates, the taxation impact of fictitious income and expenses;
                              the reassessment of vesting criteria based on restated financial information
                              relating to employee share grants, the classification of external

                              covenants and the recognition of adjustments not previously considered

                              </h4>
<p>Historically, through a series of linked transactions, the Group
                              sold a significant property portfolio at inflated values to Hemisphere,
                              an entity that was considered to be outside the Group at the time
                              the Group disposed of the properties (27 June 2008). From 30 June
                              2008 the Group held a 45% interest in Hemisphere, which was increased
                              to 100% on 31 July 2009, at which point the Group determined that
                              it had obtained control over Hemisphere resulting in such properties
                              being consolidated with higher values.
                              </p>
<p>Management has concluded that the Group controlled Hemisphere at
                              the time of its incorporation (25 June 2008) since Hemisphere conducted
                              activities on behalf of the Group. Hemisphere held the properties
                              that were sold and leased back by the Group. Hemisphere was financed
                              by the Group and was dependent on the Group's use of the properties
                              to repay the financing and was as such running on a ring-fenced basis.
                              Since the Group controlled Hemisphere when Hemisphere acquired the
                              property portfolio the uplift in property values arising from the
                              series of linked transactions has been reversed.
                              </p>

<p>The series of transactions that led to the acquisition of a significant
                              property portfolio by Hemisphere from the Group was facilitated by
                              external counterparties that had existing loans with the Group. The
                              transactions happened within a very short period of time and the Group
                              continued to use the properties, via leases. Although the contractual
                              terms of the transactions do not provide evidence of linkage, management
                              has concluded that the series of transactions leading to the acquisition
                              of the properties by Hemisphere are in substance linked since there
                              is no apparent economic reason for structuring the sale of the properties
                              to Hemisphere in this way. The transactions all relate to the same
                              properties and therefore to the same risks in addition to having taken
                              place over a short period of time.
                              </p>
<p>Management has concluded that even though the Group only held a
                              45% interest in Hemisphere in June 2008, it controlled Hemisphere
                              since the activities of Hemisphere were conducted on the Group's behalf
                              according to its specific business needs, being the continued use
                              of the properties. The Group provided financing to Hemisphere in order
                              to acquire the properties which demonstrates that Hemisphere was running
                              on a ring-fenced basis where the revenue received from the lease of
                              properties by the Group was used to repay the financing provided by
                              the Group. In this way the Group was exposed to the majority of the
                              risks and benefits related to Hemisphere.

<p>During the 2014 financial year, in another series of transactions,
                              Hemisphere acquired a United Kingdom property portfolio through a
                              company, Alvaglen. Management identified a potential conflict of interest
                              involving certain key management personnel. It would have been appropriate
                              to test these properties for impairment based on the substance of
                              the transaction at the acquisition date to determine whether the acquisition
                              values were inflated. The acquisition price was settled by issuing
                              Steinhoff shares. The Group obtained a third party property fair valuation
                              at 1 July 2015 for these properties and as a consequence impaired
                              the properties. As such a net decrease in net assets at 30 September
                              2016 and 1 July 2015 of, respectively, €55 million and €64 million
                              was recorded.

<p>Management reconsidered the residual values and useful lives of
                              the material property portfolios within the Group during the extensive
                              valuation process that was carried out. Management has corrected the
                              residual values and the useful lives of certain of the properties.
                              The assessment of residual values and useful lives is a critical estimate
                              as in some instances reliable external information is unavailable
                              and the practicality of applying consistent judgement is limited.
                              The revision of the depreciable amounts of certain properties have
                              resulted in a further net decrease in net assets at 30 September 2016
                              and 1 July 2015 of €41 million and €23 million respectively.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">a) GT Branding:</h4>
<p>Over a number of years, the Group entered into a series of transactions
                              relating to the sale and repurchase of certain of its brands and trademarks
                              at inflated values. Both internally generated and purchased brands
                              and trademarks were sold to and repurchased from companies inside
                              and outside the Group over this period of time. These brands and trademarks
                              continued to be used exclusively by Group companies. On 1 July 2015
                              the Group held a 45% equity interest in the GT Branding Group, which
                              legally owned the brands and trademarks. The Group recognised this
                              as an equity accounted investment, which included a loan receivable
                              from the GT Branding Group. As a result of this series of transactions,
                              the Group historically recognised profits relating to the disposal
                              of these brands and trademarks with an eventual corresponding increase
                              in assets being the equity accounted investment and loan receivable.
                              Throughout this period the Group recognised royalties paid for the
                              use of the brands and trademarks and also recognised income from GT
                              Branding for marketing support it provided in turn.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgements</h4>
<p>It was determined that since the Group continued to exclusively
                              use and manage these brands and trademarks over this period of time
                              the Group retained the risks and rewards of ownership regardless of
                              legal title. Therefore in considering the substance of the series
                              of transactions, no profit should have been recognised on the disposal
                              of the internally generated brands and trademarks. In relation to
                              brands and trademarks purchased from third parties these should have
                              been recognised by the Group at the original cost to the Group with
                              no profit recognised on subsequent disposals which are common control
                              transactions.
                              </p>
<p>The Group measured the fair value of the non-controlling interest
                              in the GT Branding Group as zero, upon initial recognition, as in
                              substance the Group never achieved derecognition of the brands and
                              therefore any non-controlling interest would not share in the net
                              asset value of the GT Branding Group.
                              </p>
<p>The total impact of reversing royalties paid and historical profit
                              recognised on the disposal of internally generated brands and trademarks,
                              together with the continued recognition of the GT Branding Group led
                              to a reduction in net assets at 30 September 2016 of €845 million
                              and €819 million at 1 July 2015. The profit for the period ended 30
                              September 2016 was reduced by €42 million.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">b) Know-how:</h4>
<p>From 2009 the Group recognised income relating to the sale of Know-how
                              which pertains to commercial knowledge, finance, logistics, wholesale,
                              IT, sourcing, manufacturing, as well as the development and implementation
                              of retail trade concepts on loan account to the Talgarth Group. The
                              Talgarth Group therefore held the rights to use, license, develop
                              and exploit such Know-how concepts. During 2016 and 2017, the Group
                              entered into a settlement agreement with Talgarth and paid Talgarth
                              a fee of €19.8 million.
                              </p>
<p>The Group also entered into profit sharing arrangements with the
                              Talgarth Group resulting in the Group recognising income and related
                              receivables.
                              </p>
<p>The recoverability of the Talgarth Group receivables was substantiated
                              through the transfer and cession of receivables between Group entities.
                              In certain instances, payments were received from entities outside
                              the Group to settle the Talgarth receivables, but such payments had
                              been funded by Group entities. In some cases, the receivables were
                              recognised as either intangible assets, goodwill, properties, cash
                              equivalents or a combination thereof, as a result of a series of complex
                              interrelated transactions with limited or no substance.
                              </p>
<p>Management has concluded that the Know-how transactions lacked
                              economic substance and have therefore been reversed.
                              </p>
<p>The impact of reversing the Know-how transactions led to a reduction
                              in net assets at 30 September 2016 of €4.3 billion and €3.3 billion
                              at 1 July 2015. The profit for the period ended 30 September 2016
                              was reduced by €971 million.

<p>During November 2013 subsidiaries of GIH, not consolidated by the

                              including its retail business and properties. The acquisition was
                              facilitated and largely funded by the Group.
                              </p>
<p>In June 2014 GIH sold the kika-Leiner properties to the Group.
                              The Group accounted for this transaction as a business combination
                              in the 2014 financial year.

<p>In order to list on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 7 December
                              2015 the Group was restructured resulting in the Group acquiring GIH,
                              including the remaining kika-Leiner retail business through a reverse
                              acquisition. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination
                              in the 2016 financial year.

<p>In reconsidering the extent of the Group's involvement in GIH's
                              acquisition of the kika-Leiner retail business and properties in 2013,
                              management has concluded that the Group had de facto control over
                              GIH due to the purpose and design of GIH and the practical ability
                              to control and should have consolidated kika-Leiner from November
                              2013. Management's conclusion took into consideration, inter alia,
                              the Group's decision to appoint GIH as its nominee in acquiring kika-Leiner,
                              together with the Group's involvement in the structuring and funding
                              of the acquisition of kika-Leiner by GIH.
                              </p>
<p>The statement of financial position at 1 July 2015 has been restated
                              to include the consolidation of GIH and kika-Leiner from November
                              2013, accordingly the accounting by the Group of the property acquisition
                              in 2014 and the retail business acquisition in 2016 have been reversed.
                              </p>
<p>The restatement resulted in a decrease in total equity at 30 September
                              2016 of €86 million and €197 million at 1 July 2015. The revenue for

<p>Although management cannot determine whether the activities of
                              GIH are restricted prior to December 2015, information procured suggests
                              it was incorporated solely for the benefit of the Group in that it
                              would be the Group's nominee used to acquire kika-Leiner and would
                              serve as the Group's European listing vehicle. The Group was a party
                              to the kika-Leiner acquisition acting as guarantor to the transaction.
                              The Group further provided the majority of the funding. Despite uncertainty
                              over the Group's voting rights in GIH, management has concluded that
                              the Group had de facto control over GIH as a result of its ability
                              to direct the relevant activities, identified as being a nominee of
                              the Group in the kika-Leiner transaction and eventual listing vehicle,

                              provided. In this way the Group was able to use its power to affect
                              the returns of GIH as a result of its relationship with GIH and the
                              exposure to the funding put in place to benefit from the eventual
                              listing.

<p>In order to account for the business combination in November 2013
                              management has applied reasoned judgement in estimating the fair values
                              of identifiable assets and liabilities based on available information.
                              The purchase price of €591 million was allocated as follows:

<p>The Group performed its first detailed external property valuation

                              </h4>
<p>Triton V is a special purpose entity in which the Group initially
                              had a limited interest equity ownership. Triton V is the immediate
                              parent of GIH and received €375 million of the funding required for
                              the kika-Leiner transaction from the Group. Without insight into all
                              the relevant activities of the entity, management has applied reasoned
                              judgement in concluding that Triton V was created in connection with
                              the acquisition of kika-Leiner . Despite another entity holding a
                              51% voting interest in Triton V, transactions entered into were for
                              the benefit of the Group and it emerged that the Group was managing
                              the activities of Triton V. The Group also entered into a management
                              contract with Triton V to provide Triton V with funding, accounting,
                              supervisory board mandates, central treasury, consulting and services
                              of business executives. Without access to the financial information
                              of Triton V, management believe that Triton V was wholly funded and/or
                              guaranteed by the Group due to the nature of the entity being a limited
                              interest company. Management deemed it appropriate to consolidate
                              Triton V from the date the initial investment was made as it was exposed
                              to variable returns through its funding provided and exercised power
                              over the entity's relevant activities as it appeared to have been
                              set up solely for the purposes of the Group. The consolidation of
                              Triton V however, has no impact on the results of the Group as the
                              known net asset value consolidated in the opening balances as at 1
                              July 2015 is negligible following a capital reduction by Triton V
                              during 2014. It is assumed based on the limited interest nature of
                              Triton V, that Triton V did not enter into any activities unrelated
                              to the Group.

<p>A scheme of arrangement was approved by SIHPL shareholders whereby
                              Steinhoff N.V. acquired the entire issued share capital of SIHPL.
                              As consideration, SIHPL shareholders received one share in Steinhoff
                              N.V. for each SIHPL share transferred. The scheme became operative
                              at the date of the FSE listing (7 December 2015) and SIHPL became
                              a wholly owned subsidiary of Steinhoff N.V.
                              </p>
<p>Steinhoff N.V. was introduced as a new holding company and, as
                              a result of the earlier consolidation of GIH, there was no change
                              to the underlying assets of the Group when Steinhoff N.V. was incorporated
                              as the ultimate holding company. The issued share capital of the new
                              holding company, Steinhoff N.V., differed to the existing issued share
                              capital of SIHPL and previously, the Group accounted for the difference
                              as a reverse acquisition reserve. The €10.3 billion previously recognised
                              as a reverse acquisition reserve has been netted off against share
                              premium as at 30 September 2016.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">b) POCO</h4>
<p>In 2007 a joint venture was formed between companies affiliated
                              to Seifert, Pohlmann and the Group in respect of a German furniture
                              retailer, POCO. As at 1 July 2012, Seifert held a 50% interest in
                              POCO, Pohlmann had a 50% interest and the Group had a 50% interest
                              in LiVest which held the other 50% interest in POCO, thus giving the
                              Group an economic interest of 25%. Pohlmann agreed to provide the
                              Group a casting vote in respect of LiVest and as a result the Group
                              also obtained his casting vote in relation to the appointment of the
                              key management of POCO. The casting vote in POCO would expire in March
                              2017.
                              </p>
<p>The Group historically concluded that it controlled POCO and consolidated
                              POCO with no non-controlling interest since 2012. From April 2015,
                              the Group recognised a liability in respect of Seifert's 50% shareholding
                              as it was believed that certain actions taken had resulted in the
                              Group's right to purchase his 50% shareholding (the "squeeze out").
                              </p>
<p>The Dutch POCO Proceedings was brought before the Enterprise Chamber
                              in 2015 by Seifert. Seifert argued that the consolidation of POCO
                              by the Group in the audited 2016 consolidated financial statements
                              was inappropriate. The Enterprise Chamber in its judgment ruled that
                              the Group was correct to consolidate POCO in its 2016 consolidated
                              financial statements, however, it ordered that the Group reflect a
                              50% non-controlling interest related to Seifert and reverse the liability
                              raised for the payment of the 50% interest related to the squeeze
                              out.
                              </p>
<p>On 30 September 2015 Steinhoff's effective interest in POCO increased
                              from 25% to 50% as the majority of Pohlmann's interest in LiVest was
                              swapped for Steinhoff shares. It is noted that in September 2018 Pohlmann
                              has instituted legal proceedings to have the share swap set aside.
                              A confidential settlement agreement was reached during the 2019 financial
                              year and an amount was provided for in the 2017 financial year as
                              this was considered to be an adjusting subsequent event. Refer to
                              note 21 for details regarding the provision.
                              </p>
<p>Taking into consideration the agreements entered into between various
                              parties judgment has been applied in concluding that the casting vote
                              at a POCO level would provide the Group with control. Management has
                              therefore concluded that POCO should be consolidated from July 2007
                              up until March 2017 when the casting vote expired. This is also in
                              line with the ruling of the Dutch POCO Proceedings that the Group
                              controlled POCO.
                              </p>
<p>The restatement at 1 July 2015 consists of the recognition of a
                              75% non-controlling interest in POCO and the reversal of the liability
                              and goodwill recognised in respect of the squeeze out and earlier
                              transactions. The restatement at 30 September 2016 consists of the
                              recognition of a 75% non-controlling interest up until 30 September
                              2015 and a 50% non-controlling interest up until 31 March 2017 and
                              the reversal of the liability and goodwill recognised in respect of
                              the squeeze out and earlier transactions. The reduction in the non-controlling
                              interest is as a result of Pohlmann swapping his interest in LiVest
                              for Steinhoff shares on 30 September 2015.
                              </p>
<p>The original investment in POCO and the subsequent additional investments
                              in POCO were incorrectly accounted for resulting in the incorrect
                              recognition of goodwill of €638 million, property step ups of €118
                              million and brand names of €115 million recognised for discontinued
                              brands. Management believe no third party valuations were performed
                              at the time of the initial acquisition, and therefore reversed all
                              step-ups in value. These reversals had an impact on the profit recognised
                              on derecognition of POCO as a subsidiary in March 2017.
                              </p>
<p>The reversals of these balances together with the recognition of
                              a non-controlling interest of €195 million and €286 million as at
                              30 September 2016 and 1 July 2015, respectively resulted in a decrease
                              in total equity of €302 million as at 30 September 2016 and €81 million
                              as at 1 July 2015. There is no material impact to profit or loss for
                              the period ended 30 September 2016.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgements</h4>
<p>Management concluded that despite having a 25% economic interest
                              in POCO at the date of acquisition, the Group controlled POCO since
                              Pohlmann had agreed to provide his casting vote in POCO to the Group
                              since he had provided the Group with a casting vote in respect of
                              LiVest. The casting vote expired in March 2017. The Dutch POCO Proceedings
                              also ruled that the Group controlled POCO, but with a 50% non-controlling
                              interest. The Group has reflected a 75% non-controlling interest to
                              also take Pohlmann's share in LiVest into consideration.
                              </p>
<p>Despite Pohlmann having instituted legal proceedings to have his
                              share swap set aside, management has considered the share swap to
                              have been effective since Pohlmann at the time took ownership of the
                              Steinhoff shares and have therefore reduced the non-controlling interest
                              to Pohlmann accordingly.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">c) Conforama</h4>
<p>During the years 2007 to 2014 the Group and entities affiliated
                              with Seifert entered into various agreements and memorandums of understanding
                              to acquire and continue funding Conforama.
                              </p>
<p>The total funding required to purchase Conforama (March 2011) and
                              to provide Conforama with working capital facilities, increased from
                              €1.2 billion to €2 billion by 2014, with Seifert funding €299.9 million
                              and the Group funding the remainder.
                              </p>
<p>On 19 January 2015, the Group declared the termination of the 2011
                              Agreements, the Commitment Letter and the 2014 Share Purchase Agreement
                              ("2014 SPA") with immediate effect for good cause.
                              </p>
<p>The Group is of the opinion that Seifert breached its contractual
                              obligations since November 2014.
                              </p>
<p>The Group concluded it controlled Conforama and did not account
                              for any non-controlling interest relating to Seifert's interest in
                              Conforama.
                              </p>
<p>It is management's view that Seifert's interest was similar to
                              a equity ownership interest in Conforama. As a result the Group has
                              recognised a provision equal to 23.6% of Conforama's equity value
                              on 19 January 2015 for the termination settlement amount.

<p>The Group acquired approximately 4.9% of the shareholding in Brait
                              from 2014 to 2016. Previously the shares were measured at fair value
                              with gains and losses on the shares being reported in profit or loss
                              until the date on which the shares were recognised as being sold (in
                              the 2016 financial year) to Plum Tree, which is part of the Campion
                              Group. Management has considered the outcome of the control assessments
                              performed on the Campion Group and since the Group does not control
                              the Campion Group, the accounting treatment of the underlying transactions
                              including the Brait shares and the sale to Plum Tree were reconsidered
                              for both the appropriateness of the recognition of the fair value
                              adjustments in profit or loss and the date on which control of the
                              shares was transferred.

<p>IAS 39 contains certain requirements for an asset to be designated

                              to meet the designation requirements for this category under IAS 39.
                              The shares should therefore rather have been classified as "available-for-sale",
                              with fair value gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive

                              </h4>
<p>Management has concluded that the sale of the shares should have
                              been recognised in the 2017 consolidated financial statements as the
                              sale of share agreement between the Group and Plum Tree was only signed
                              during the 2017 financial year and the transfer of shares was during
                              the 2017 year.
                              </p>
<p>The 2016 consolidated financial statements have therefore been
                              restated to recognise fair value adjustments in other comprehensive
                              income rather than profit or loss, and for the full financial year
                              eliminating the impact of the sale recognised in the 2016 financial
                              period. As a result of a significant decline in the share price between
                              the date on which the sale transaction had previously been recognised
                              and the financial year-end, there has been a reduction in net assets
                              of €96 million as at 30 September 2016. The change in classification
                              resulted in a reduction in other income of €84 million for the period
                              ended 30 September 2016.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">e) BVI</h4>
<p>Business Venture Investments 1449 (RF) Proprietary Limited ("BVI")
                              was founded in 2011 by the senior management of Pepkor with the objective
                              of enabling senior employees of Pepkor to share in the growth of the
                              company over a long term by indirectly owning shares in Pepkor through
                              the BVI structure. Pepkor granted loans to certain senior employees
                              to enable them to buy their allocated BVI shares, but a number of
                              employees also funded their own investments. The structure also received
                              funding from Rand Merchant Bank ("RMB"). Companies in the Pepkor Group
                              guaranteed the RMB funding.
                              </p>
<p>BVI shares not allocated to employees were taken up by a Pepkor
                              company with the purpose of later allocating these shares to employees
                              joining the scheme. The Group holds a 17% (2016: 6%) shareholding
                              in BVI.
                              </p>
<p>On 20 April 2015, following the acquisition of Pepkor by the Group,
                              the Pepkor shares held by BVI were swapped for Steinhoff shares. From
                              2016 when an employee wanted to exit the BVI structure, the Group
                              would also provide a loan to BVI to fund the repurchase of its BVI
                              shares from the employer as opposed to BVI having to sell Steinhoff
                              shares to fund the settlement.
                              </p>
<p>Previously, the investment in and loan receivable from BVI was
                              recognised together as loans and receivables at amortised cost.

                              of BVI
                              </h4>
<p>BVI was set up solely on behalf of the employee shareholders who
                              would benefit from the growth of the Pepkor Group and later the Steinhoff
                              share value and allowed the employees the discretion of when to exit
                              the structure. Since the Group's acquisition of Pepkor, it continued
                              to act as guarantor to the RMB funding, and also facilitated the exit
                              of employees by either providing the necessary funding to BVI or by
                              permitting BVI to dispose of shares in order to fund the share repurchase
                              from the employee.
                              </p>
<p>Although the Group's voting rights were limited to their equity
                              interests, management has concluded that the Group had de facto control
                              over BVI or as a result of its exposure to variable returns linked
                              to the funding and guarantees provided.
                              </p>
<p>Management have considered the date from which BVI structure should
                              be consolidated by the Group and concluded this date to be during
                              March 2015 when it acquired the Pepkor Group.
                              </p>
<p>Upon consolidation, the Group recognised the Steinhoff shares held
                              by BVI as treasury shares.
                              </p>
<p>Management have limited financial information of BVI and therefore
                              deemed the value of the treasury shares to approximate BVI's capital
                              raised and the funding procured.
                              </p>
<p>During the 2016 period, BVI repurchased some of its own shares.
                              These repurchases were funded through the disposal of Steinhoff shares
                              and also with funding from Pepkor. The repurchase values were calculated
                              by BVI with reference to the market value of the Steinhoff shares
                              and the outstanding BVI debt. The difference between the repurchase
                              price and the value of the treasury shares recognised on consolidation,
                              has been recognised directly in equity as the excess of the consideration
                              paid to non-controlling interests.
                              </p>
<p>Upon consolidation, any investment in BVI held by the Group and
                              loans receivable from BVI have been eliminated. Dividends paid to
                              BVI by the Group by virtue of BVI's Steinhoff shareholding have been
                              eliminated and any dividends paid by BVI to employee shareholders
                              have been recognised as dividends paid to non-controlling interest
                              and dividends received from BVI by the Group were eliminated.
                              </p>
<p>The impact of the consolidation of BVI has led to a reduction in
                              net assets at 30 September 2016 of €56 million and €32 million at
                              1 July 2015. Non-controlling interests of €8 million and €18 million
                              were recognised at 30 September 2016 and 1 July 2015 respectively.
                              There is no material impact to profit or loss for the period ended
                              30 September 2016.

<p>Additionally management considered whether share-based payment
                              expenses should be recognised in respect of the structure. Management
                              concluded that since senior employees bought the shares at market
                              value, loans granted to employees were full recourse loans granted
                              at market related terms, and no vesting conditions were attached,
                              no share-based payment expense should have been recognised.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">f) Habufa</h4>
<p>The Group recognised its 50% interest in Habufa as a subsidiary
                              and consolidated its investment in the Habufa group recognising a
                              50% non-controlling interest. It was determined that the Group had
                              joint rather than unilateral control of Habufa and therefore consolidation
                              was inappropriate. Accordingly the interest in the Habufa group was
                              incorrectly accounted for and should have been recognised as an investment
                              in a joint venture and equity accounted.
                              </p>
<p>The impact of consolidating has been reversed on a line by line
                              basis and an equity accounted investment of €17 million (1 July 2015:
                              €15 million) was recognised as at 30 September 2016. The restatement
                              led to a net reduction of total assets as at 30 September 2016 of
                              €45 million (1 July 2015: €47 million) and liabilities of €28 million
                              (1 July 2015: €33 million).

<p>TG did not in fact negotiate or collect contributions from third
                              parties on behalf of the Group. Payments received in respect of the
                              amounts owing by TG were received from entities within the Group i.e.
                              there were no external cash flows into the Group. Management therefore
                              concluded that there was no substance to the income or reduction in

<p>Management therefore reversed all the contributions received. The
                              restatement resulted in a decrease in net assets at 30 September 2016
                              and 1 July 2015 of €1.2 billion and €845 million respectively. The
                              profit or loss for the period decreased with €248 million.

<p>The amounts outstanding from TG and the Talgarth Group (refer to
                              note 1.2.2b "Know-how transactions") were periodically presented as
                              cash and cash equivalents, instead of a receivable owed by third parties.
                              These reclassifications had been made on the basis that entities in
                              the Group entered into bills of exchange (also referred to as Wechsels)
                              with the parties owing such amounts. Had the receivables been valid,
                              it would not have been appropriate to reclassify these balances as
                              cash and cash equivalents as neither the derecognition criteria for
                              receivables, per the requirements of IAS 39, nor the definition of
                              cash and cash equivalents, IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows ("IAS 7"),
                              had been satisfied.
                              </p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were overstated by €2.2 billion at 30
                              September 2016 and €2.3 billion at 1 July 2015. The impact of the
                              restatements to cash and cash equivalents on the net assets is included

<p>The Group recognised three annual contributions from Triton B.
                              Also see note 1.2.5c where Triton B has been identified as a party
                              to which a loan was provided to purchase Steinhoff shares.
                              </p>
<p>The following contributions were paid in cash to the Group: €11
                              million in 2014, €21 million in 2015, €9 million in 2016.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgement</h4>
<p>The contributions received in 2014 and 2015 had no impact on the
                              restated total equity at 1 July 2015 as the contributions were received
                              in cash with no obligation to refund these amounts. Management expects
                              that the contributions were funded either through profits on disposal
                              of Steinhoff shares or indirectly through loans provided by other
                              Group entities to outside parties, which have already been impaired
                              elsewhere by the Group. There does not appear to be any business rationale
                              for the payment of the contributions, but as it appears as if the
                              Group provided the necessary funding by means of loans which have
                              already been impaired, the contributions of €9 million received in
                              2016 was recognised in expenses to offset against impairments recognised.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">a) SSUK</h4>
<p>Sunnyside and Sutherland UK are two entities (collectively referred
                              to as the "SSUK") which purchased 150 million Steinhoff shares from
                              Brait for cash during October 2015 by obtaining loan funding from
                              the Group. The loan agreement (which was only reduced to writing in
                              November 2016) included an option for the Group to repurchase the
                              Steinhoff shares, which was exercised on 29 September 2016. The Steinhoff
                              shares were sold on the same day by the Group to Upington for cash.
                              The Group recognised the funding advanced to SSUK as a debit to treasury
                              shares in the 2016 consolidated financial statements.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgements</h4>
<p>There remains uncertainty with respect to the relevant activities
                              of the SSUK entities, which are part of the Campion Group, which could
                              extend beyond transactions with the Group, although it appears that
                              the purpose of the entities was to hold Steinhoff shares. There is
                              not sufficient evidence to suggest that the Group can control the
                              activities of the entities in the absence of holding voting rights
                              and since the repayment of the loan to the Group is dependent on the
                              performance of the underlying Steinhoff shares, the Group is exposed
                              to negative returns from SSUK. Management has concluded that the Group
                              did not control these entities. The third party shareholders of SSUK
                              are only exposed to possible upside to the extent that the value of
                              the Steinhoff shares exceeds the funding provided by the Group. In
                              substance, such a structure is akin to the Group issuing a call option
                              on its own shares, and an equity-settled share-based payment expense
                              should therefore have been recognised in the 2016 financial period.
                              In addition, the funding advanced to SSUK should remain recognised
                              as a debit to treasury shares until such time as the loans are repaid
                              by exercising the in-substance option. The 2016 financial results
                              have therefore been restated by recognising the share-based payment
                              expense amounting to €29.7 million. Refer to note 32.2 with specific
                              reference to SSUK1 and SSUK2. The in substance option relating to
                              SSUK1 was exercised by 30 September 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Refer to note 29.3 for details regarding the underwriting fee paid
                              to Upington for the subscription of the SSUK shares and note 32.2a
                              (SSUK1 and SSUK2) for more detail on the valuation methodology and
                              assumptions applied in determining the share-based payment expense.
                              </p>
<p>Interest income and commission expense were recognised in profit
                              or loss relating to the loans granted to SSUK during 2016. Management
                              deemed these items to have no economic substance. As the loan was
                              settled by 30 September 2016, the interest income of €22 million and
                              the commission expense of €8 million was reversed and recognised directly
                              in equity.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">b) Top Global</h4>
<p>In March 2011 the Group acquired a 99.98% interest in Conforama
                              for €1.2 billion to be settled in cash and the issue of 131.9 million
                              Steinhoff shares. The seller renounced its rights to the Steinhoff
                              shares to a third party, for cash.
                              </p>
<p>Consequently Aureum, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Top Global, a
                              subsidiary of the Talgarth Group, acquired the 131.9 million Steinhoff
                              shares for €300 million. This was funded by the Group by means of
                              a loan to Top Global.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgements</h4>
<p>Management assumed that the repayment of the loan to Top Global
                              was dependent on the performance of the underlying Steinhoff shares
                              as these seemed to be the only significant assets held by Aureum.
                              The Group was therefore exposed to negative returns from Top Global
                              in respect of the funding it had provided, and Top Global was exposed
                              to the possible upside to the extent the value of the Steinhoff shares
                              exceeded the funding provided by the Group. In substance, such a structure
                              is akin to the Group having issued a call option on its own shares.
                              A sharebased payment expense should therefore have been recognised
                              in the period ending 30 June 2012. Accordingly, the shares held by
                              Top Global should have been recognised as treasury shares until such
                              time as the loan was repaid by exercising the in-substance option.
                              As at 1 July 2015 Top Global had made a number of payments to the
                              Group which management has allocated to the initial loan advance.
                              As such there is no impact to the opening balance on 1 July 2015 as
                              the option is considered to be exercised resulting from the majority
                              settlement of the loan. This is because the share-based payment expenses
                              recognised in retained income would have been offset by the amounts
                              transferred from the share-based payment reserve when the options
                              were deemed to be exercised.
                              </p>
<p>Additional loan advances, unrelated to the original share purchase
                              transaction, were made to Top Global by the Group and recognised as
                              loan receivables, together with interest thereon. Management has concluded
                              the receivable balance as at 30 September 2016 and 1 July 2015 were
                              irrecoverable due to an inability to enforce repayment and an absence
                              of guarantees. The restatement resulted in a decrease in net assets
                              at 30 September 2016 and 1 July 2015 of €237 million and €219 million
                              respectively.
                              </p>
<p>It is not clear as to the purpose and design of Top Global, although
                              it appears the structure was used to facilitate the purchase and sale
                              of Steinhoff shares in addition to having been used to facilitate
                              other transactions in the Group, although it could have extended beyond
                              transactions with the Group. Steinhoff remains exposed to variable
                              returns as a result of loans granted. Despite indicators of control,
                              no conclusive information exists to confirm that Steinhoff in fact
                              controlled Top Global. The Group has accounted for the transactions
                              it entered into with Top Global in order to reflect the substance
                              of the underlying transactions and the Group's exposure.

<p>Repayment of the loan provided by the Group for the purchase of
                              Steinhoff shares by Triton B was dependent on the performance of the
                              underlying shares. The Group was therefore exposed to negative returns
                              from Triton B, whereas the third party shareholders of Triton B were
                              only exposed to possible upside to the extent that the value of the

                              the shares held by Triton B should have remained recognised as treasury
                              shares until such time as the loan was repaid. As at 1 July 2015,
                              Triton B has substantially settled the loan through repayments or
                              cessions. As such there is no impact to the opening balance on 1 July
                              2015 as the option is considered to be exercised resulting from the
                              majority settlement of the loan. This is because the share-based payment
                              expenses recognised in retained income would have been offset by the
                              amounts transferred from the share-based payment reserve when the

<p>Management considered whether the Group controlled Triton B. It
                              appears as though Triton B was used to facilitate certain transactions

                              </h4>
<p>The various restatements led to forecast information used in determining
                              the recoverable amounts of CGUs for purposes of goodwill and brand
                              impairment testing being revised to reflect the capabilities of operations
                              at that time. The Group has also revised the WACC rates in line with
                              the revised risk profile and size of the Group to reflect market participants
                              risk appetite for businesses in the Group based on their restated
                              results. Since such impairments result from the restatements, the
                              impairment testing has been rolled back to earlier years reflecting
                              the state of affairs of the Group at such points in time.
                              </p>
<p>The Group reassessed the appropriateness of its CGUs with reference
                              to the restated reporting segments. Where goodwill was reallocated
                              to CGUs with different functional currencies, translation of such
                              goodwill resulted in adjustments to the foreign currency translation
                              reserve.
                              </p>
<p>Conforama's goodwill and brands suffered the most material impairments.
                              Conforama's goodwill and brands were valued using a pre-tax discount
                              rate of 10%, a 6% medium-term growth rate and a 1% long-term growth
                              rate. A pretax royalty rate of 1% was applied. This led to a goodwill
                              impairment of €803 million and a brand impairment of €775 million
                              for Conforama at 1 July 2015.
                              </p>
<p>Other impairments of goodwill related primarily to United Kingdom
                              household goods and Australasia household goods. Goodwill was impaired
                              by €1.2 billion in total as at 1 July 2015 with no further impact
                              to profit or loss in the 2016 financial period.

<p>Cumulative other impairments to brands and trademarks were primarily
                              due to United Kingdom household goods and Lipo, and, together with
                              Conforama, totalled €1.3 billion as at 30 September 2016 and 1 July

<p>As a result of the prior period restatements and various cross-guarantees
                              entered into between Group companies, the Group was in technical breach
                              of covenants, more specifically its net debt to EBITDA ratio and net
                              interest cover ratio and the issuance of consolidated financial statements.
                              The covenant breaches result in the loans being immediately payable
                              and the restated prior period's positions reflect these loans as current
                              liabilities, since the covenants have been recalculated taking into
                              account the restatements.

                              as at 30 September 2016 and €42 million as at 1 July 2015, increasing

<p>The classification of certain preference shares previously classified

                              available and accordingly management has classified the preference
                              shares as a current liability as at 1 July 2015 and 30 September 2016.

<p>The impact of reclassifying the preference shares at 30 September
                              2016 and 1 July 2015 is a €145.6 million decrease in preference shares

<p>The tax positions of the single entities impacted by the restatements
                              are still uncertain and detailed analyses are being performed in various
                              jurisdictions to determine the correct taxation treatment to be afforded
                              to each transaction, including those where fictitious income had previously
                              been included in taxable income and fictitious expenses were deducted
                              from taxable income. There are complexities arising in respect of
                              tax treatment and there remains a fair degree of uncertainty relating
                              to the estimation of the taxation expense and deferred tax balances.
                              Management have recognised the tax implications on latest available
                              information and best estimates.

<p>The foreign currency impacts of all restatements on translation
                              of foreign subsidiaries were considered and corrected where these

<p>A full recalculation of the reserve was not performed. Any further
                              uncorrected translation differences would result in a reclassification

                              business, the relevant FCTR should be reclassified to profit or loss
                              of disposal. As such the FCTR could have an impact on future disposal
                              profits or losses.

<p>The Group's approved long term share incentive scheme (the "ESRS")
                              had unvested grants relating to the 2014, 2016 and 2017 financial
                              years. No new grant was made during 2018. The Remcom would set and
                              monitor the achievement of the performance targets (non-market conditions)
                              in order for the ESRS to vest ("vesting criteria"). Given the material
                              restatements to prior periods, Remcom would have to apply significant
                              discretion to approve the vesting of open grants in achieving the
                              performance targets. Given all the uncertainty regarding the achievement
                              of the vesting criteria, management concluded it would therefore be
                              highly unlikely that the open grants would vest.
                              </p>
<p>Management therefore revised its estimates of the number of shares
                              likely to vest, based on all the available financial information,
                              and considers all open grants at each year-end highly unlikely to
                              vest. Management therefore reversed the IFRS 2 expense for all open
                              grants for all financial years.

<p>The reversal through profit or loss for the period ended 30 September
                              2016 amounted to a decrease in administration expenses relating to
                              share-based payments of €17 million and an increase in the related
                              income tax expense of €5 million.

<p>In 2016 the Group sold its JD Financial Services business, including
                              its Loan Book, together with certain insurance operations to Wands,
                              a subsidiary of Fulcrum SA (together the "Purchaser"). Fulcrum SA
                              is a subsidiary of Fulcrum FS, a subsidiary of Campion Capital. The
                              Group provided unsecured funding to Fulcrum which management believe
                              was used to fund the acquisition. Since all claims against this Loan
                              Book were ceded to the Purchaser, the Group derecognised the Loan
                              Book and recognised a loan receivable from the Purchaser.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgements</h4>
<p>It appears as if the Group was instrumental in setting up the structure
                              to facilitate the sale of the Loan Book and insurance operations and
                              that certain key management of the Group did have some form of special
                              relationship with the Campion Group. The Group also remains exposed
                              to variable returns as a result of the loans granted and a profit
                              share arrangement entered into with a subsidiary of Wands. However,
                              no conclusive information exists to confirm that the Group in fact
                              controlled either the Campion Group, Fulcrum or Wands, since these
                              entities also appear to be involved in other business operations (via
                              their own management) and funding transactions unrelated to the Loan
                              Book.
                              </p>
<p>In addition, management does not have access to sufficient financial
                              information to allow the Group to consolidate either Fulcrum SA, Fulcrum
                              FS or Wands.
                              </p>
<p>The Pepkor Group is not impacted by these findings as the exposure
                              to variable returns is outside the Pepkor Group. Management reassessed
                              the accounting for the derecognition of the Loan Book and determined
                              that it did not meet all the derecognition criteria of a financial
                              asset in terms of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
                              ("IAS 39") due to the Group's continuing involvement in the Loan Book
                              through certain pre-emptive, servicing and profit sharing rights.
                              As the Group provided funding to the Purchaser, it retained some degree
                              of risk associated with the Loan Book sold, since amounts not recovered
                              on the Loan Book could lead to non-payment of the loan by the Purchaser
                              (to the extent that such losses are not absorbed by the other operations
                              of the Purchaser). Therefore since the Group retained some element
                              of control (as defined in IAS 39) over the Loan Book, it should continue
                              to recognise the Loan Book to the extent of the Group's continuing
                              involvement in the Loan Book.
                              </p>
<p>At 30 September 2016 an impairment of €150 million was recognised
                              against the loans receivable (note 4.2.2c) and is included as part
                              of the restatements in note 1.2.3g.
                              </p>
<p>As there is no specific guidance in IAS 39 on how to apply continuing
                              involvement accounting in these circumstances, management has determined
                              that the outstanding balance on the loan receivable from the Purchaser
                              best reflects the amount of continuing involvement that the Group
                              has in the Loan Book, as this represents the maximum exposure that
                              the Group has to the Loan Book that was initially sold. Consequently,
                              the impairment assessment of this balance has been revised based on
                              a look-through principle, considering the provisions/write-offs on
                              the Loan Book as well as the potential of the other operations of
                              the Purchaser to contribute to the settlement of the loan.
                              </p>
<p>As the Group did not achieve derecognition of the financial asset,
                              discontinued operations presented in the 2016 financial year have
                              been represented as part of continuing operations. The impact of this
                              is not considered material to the Group and have been grouped with
                              the restatements in note 1.2.3.
                              </p>
<p>As at 1 July 2015, the Group presented the JD Financial Services
                              business (excluding the insurance businesses) as held-for-sale on
                              the statement of financial position. No adjustments are made to the
                              presentation as held-for-sale as a deal had been concluded with BNP
                              Paribas, an external third party, for which Competition Commission
                              approval had been obtained. Certain conditions imposed by the Competition
                              Commission could not be fulfilled and the deal with BNP Paribas was
                              cancelled during 2016 and replaced by the disposal to the Campion
                              Group.

<p>As a result of restatements arising from the correction of prior

                              Segments were no longer met. The aggregation of certain operating

                              reportable segments of its business based on how information is accumulated

<p>Debt is primarily raised through certain Group companies that function
                              as treasury companies for the Group. The purpose of the debt or the
                              company in which the debt is raised determines the debt cluster to
                              which the debt, cash and cash equivalents and related finance costs
                              and investment income is allocated. These debt clusters are then reviewed
                              by the CODM. Debt clusters are not consistent with reportable segments.

<p>Investment in equity accounted companies and short and long term
                              investments (financial assets) are monitored by the CODM on a Group

                              or impact their performance. Such assets are not allocated to segments.

<p>The segmental assets below are presented on a consolidated basis

                              activities of the Group, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts

<p>If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount
                              can be measured reliably, the discount is recognised as a reduction

                              transaction. The sale of Brait shares to Plum Tree was funded by the
                              Group via a loan to Fulcrum UK (both companies are part of the Campion
                              Group). The Brait share price has declined significantly since the
                              sale of the shares and the outstanding loan was without security and
                              granted to a different entity than the one holding the Brait shares.
                              Management is aware of a loan arrangement between Fulcrum UK and Plum
                              Tree, and as such the Group considered the recovery of the loan to
                              be linked to the value of the Brait shares held by Plum Tree. The
                              carrying amount of the loan granted has therefore been impaired to
                              the value of the Brait shares held by Plum Tree. (note 11.1)

<p>For periods ending 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016 the
                              corporate taxation rate in South Africa is 28%. Capital gains is taxed

<p>Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for
                              the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
                              reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
                              periods.
                              </p>
<p>The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions
                              and the calculation of the Group's tax charge and worldwide provisions
                              for income tax necessarily involves a substantial degree of estimation
                              and judgement. At any given time the Group typically has a number
                              of open tax returns with various tax authorities and engages in active
                              dialogue to resolve these. Taxation provisions relating to these open
                              items are recognised based on the Group's estimate of the most likely
                              outcome, after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
                              </p>
<p>Where the final tax outcome of these matters are different from
                              the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will
                              impact profit or loss, current and deferred income tax assets and
                              liabilities in the period such determination is made.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Deferred taxation</h4>
<p>Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences
                              between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
                              reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
                              </p>
<p>The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner
                              of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and
                              liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
                              reporting date.
                              </p>
<p>Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward
                              only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is
                              probable, on the basis of all available evidence it is considered
                              more likely than not, that there will be suitable taxable profits
                              against which the reversal of the deferred tax asset can be deducted.
                              </p>
<p>Temporary differences have arisen as a result of the translation
                              of the consolidated financial statements of the Group's subsidiaries.
                              A deferred tax liability has not been recognised as the liability
                              will only crystallise in the event of disposal of the subsidiary and
                              no such disposal was expected at the end of the reporting period.
                              </p>
<p>Certain subsidiaries in the Group have undistributed earnings which
                              if paid out as dividends, would be subject to tax in the hands of
                              the recipient. An assessable temporary difference exists, but no deferred
                              tax liability has been recognised as the parent entity is able to
                              control the timing of distributions from these subsidiaries and is
                              not expected to distribute these profits in the foreseeable future.

<p>There is uncertainty regarding the tax impact of the accounting
                              irregularities given their nature. A comprehensive tax review of the
                              consequences of these accounting irregularities across all the relevant
                              jurisdictions remains in progress and has not been completed. This
                              could result in further restatements.
                              </p>
<p>Management have estimated the tax consequences associated with
                              these accounting irregularities and where specific items that could
                              result in an increase in taxable profit have been identified, these
                              have been recognised. Where specific items that could result in a
                              reduction of taxable profit have been identified these have been ignored
                              where it is uncertain whether they will be allowed by the relevant
                              tax authorities.
                              </p>
<p>The tax position of the single entities impacted by the restatement
                              is still uncertain in multiple jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty
                              associated with such tax items, there is a possibility that the final
                              outcome may differ significantly from the current estimate.
                              </p>
<p>The Group is currently subject to ongoing general transfer pricing
                              investigation by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. If a tax
                              authority in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates, reviews
                              any of the Group's practices and determines that the transfer prices
                              and terms that the Group has applied are inappropriate or that income
                              of a division of the Group should be taxed in that jurisdiction, the
                              Group may incur increased tax liability, including accrual of interest
                              and penalties which can cause the Group's tax expense to increase.
                              </p>
<p>The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions, resulting in transfer
                              pricing being an important consideration, both at a Group and entity
                              level. The Group is currently in the process of performing a transfer
                              pricing review.
                              </p>
<p>Due to the number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates,
                              there may be uncertainty in respect of the place of effective management
                              of certain individual Group entities. Although the level of risk is
                              difficult to assess this may result in a potential future outflow
                              of resources. The Group is currently addressing this risk in consultation
                              with advisors.
                              </p>
<p>The Group is currently being investigated by Austrian and German
                              tax authorities which may result in a potential outflow of resources.
                              The Group is currently addressing this risk in consultation with its

<p>Deferred tax assets have been recognised for the carry forward

                              there is compelling evidence that it is probable that sufficient taxable
                              profits will be available in the future to utilise the tax losses
                              carried forward, either by the specific company to which it relates
                              or the wider Group. Management has carefully assessed the entities
                              ability to generate future taxable profits against which the recognised
                              tax losses can be utilised. Such assessments are based on the approved
                              budgets and the forecasts of the entities including its ability to
                              raise funding to maintain and support its operations.

<p>The impact of the impairment of the Mattress Firm goodwill and
                              brands resulted in the release of a deferred tax liability of €359
                              million during the period. Refer to note 8 for details regarding these
                              impairments.
                              </p>
<p>During the period the Group derecognised POCO as a subsidiary (refer
                              note 1.2.3b and note 10). This resulted in the derecognition of a
                              deferred tax liability relating to POCO's brand of €72 million.
                              </p>
<p>The decrease in the recognised tax losses during the period relates
                              mainly to the utilisation of tax losses by Pepkor.
                              </p>
<p>The deferred tax acquired in the previous period relates primarily
                              to the deferred tax liabilities raised on brands, recognised with
                              the aquisition of Mattress Firm and Poundland. Refer to note 24.

<p>Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject

                              impaired. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for
                              impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
                              the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
                              recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds
                              its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
                              asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the
                              purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
                              levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which

                              </h4>
<p>The Group tests whether goodwill and trade and brand names with
                              indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment at least on an
                              annual basis. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based
                              on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions.
                              The calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on financial
                              budgets approved by management. Models were build over a five year
                              period with terminal growth thereafter. The majority of the approved
                              budgets cover a three year period, but some businesses also approved
                              budgets covering a five year period.
                              </p>
<p>Where only a three year budget is approved, cash flows beyond the
                              three year period are extrapolated using estimated medium-term growth
                              rates. These growth rates are linked with forecasts specific to the
                              industry and geographic location in which the CGU operates.
                              </p>
<p>WACC is a key factor in determining the pre-tax discount rate to
                              be applied to the cash flow projections. The restatements have resulted
                              in a decline in the Group's investment rating subsequent to the end
                              of the reporting period. As such, the CGU specific WACC has been adjusted
                              for what the Group estimates the cost of borrowing would have been,
                              for each business, if the business borrowed at rates impacted by the
                              lower investment rating of the Group. The cost of equity was adjusted
                              to include additional risk factors, such as forecast risk, to incorporate
                              the current uncertain trading conditions of the Group. The cost of
                              equity has also been adjusted with size premiums, where applicable,
                              to take into account the restated size of each CGU.
                              </p>
<p>The additional key assumptions relating to the impairment testing
                              of the trade names and brands are based on royalty rates applicable
                              to the specific brand based on the industry in which the brand operates
                              and the profitability of the unit. The same discount rate is applied
                              in the royalty and value-in-use models.
                              </p>
<p>The following table sets out the key assumptions for those CGU's
                              that have significant goodwill and/or trade and brand names allocated

                              </h4>
<p>The goodwill impairment charge of €2.5 billion (2016: €nil) arose
                              for this CGU. The integration of the Sleepy's acquisition resulted
                              in too many store locations for this brand. Further, the rebranding
                              of all Sleepy's and Sleep Train stores (comprising c. 40% of the store
                              base) to Mattress Firm stores was accelerated and executed in areas
                              where the brand was not as well known. The brand name included in
                              this CGU was impaired by €652 million (2016: €nil). The major classes
                              of assets impaired were; goodwill and brand names. Goodwill is fully
                              impaired.
                              </p>
<p>As at 30 September 2017, the carrying amount of the CGU, after
                              the impairments, was similar to its recoverable amount. The recoverable
                              amount was calculated at €487 million.
                              </p>
<p>As this unit was significantly impaired during the reporting period,
                              any changes to the key assumptions could result in further impairments
                              of other assets. The recoverable amount of other assets may be tested
                              using other valuation methods, as such the sensitivities below may
                              not result in further impairment or reversals of impairments. Management

<p>A goodwill impairment charge of €119 million (2016: €nil) arose
                              for this CGU. The business plan for Poundland includes store roll-outs
                              in new territories and head count reductions due to back office integrations
                              and efficiencies. Based on IAS36, these initiatives cannot be taken

                              merchandise unit of Australasia. This business was restructured to
                              form part of the Group's Australian unit during 2016, and a new management
                              team was introduced during 2017. This lead to a change in certain
                              strategic initiatives and the discontinuance of certain brands. As
                              at 30 September 2017 the carrying and recoverable amounts of this
                              general merchandise Australasia unit are €168 million post impairment.
                              The material remaining assets in this unit are property, inventory
                              and brands. These assets have been separately tested and are deemed
                              recoverable. Adjusting the key drivers of the value-in-use model is

<p>As a result of the earlier consolidation of kika-Leiner (refer

                              The fair values were compared to the local GAAP book values to determine

<p>The Group is in the process of also doing a full external valuation

                              (2016: nil) was recognised in profit or loss on this portfolio as
                              a result of internal valuations performed. The South African properties

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Associates</h4>
<p>Associates are entities over which the group has significant influence
                              but not control or joint control. This is generally the case where
                              the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments
                              in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting,
                              after initially being recognised at cost.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Joint arrangements</h4>
<p>Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint
                              operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual
                              rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure
                              of the joint arrangement. The Group only has joint ventures.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Joint ventures</h4>
<p>Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity
                              method, after initially being recognised at cost.

                              interests
                              </h4>
<p>The Group's interest in an associate or joint venture includes
                              long-term interests that form part of the Group's net investment.
                              Such long-term interests include ordinary and preference shares and
                              long-term receivables or loans. The long-term interests are akin to
                              an equity investment.
                              </p>
<p>Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures
                              is included in the carrying amount of the associates and joint ventures.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Equity method</h4>
<p>Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially
                              recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's
                              share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in
                              profit or loss, and the Group's share of movements in other comprehensive
                              income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received
                              or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as
                              a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
                              </p>
<p>When the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment
                              equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other
                              unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further
                              losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf
                              of the other entity.
                              </p>
<p>Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates
                              and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group's interest
                              in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
                              transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
                              </p>
<p>If a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive

<p>When there is a dilution in the Group's shareholding in an investment

<p>Investments in equity accounted companies are tested for impairment
                              whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
                              amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for
                              the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
                              amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value
                              less costs of disposal and value-in-use.

<p>The Group acquired a 17% strategic interest in SRP during July
                              2017 for €158.6 million. The Group entered into voting agreements
                              with the founding shareholders and Steinhoff N.V. is also represented
                              on the board of SRP. As such, the Group established it has significant
                              influence over SRP and SRP is therefore equity accounted.
                              </p>
<p>SRP is a separately listed entity with a December financial year-end.
                              No equity accounted earnings for SRP are recognised by the Group in
                              the 2017 results owing to the delay in obtaining December 2017 year-end
                              financial information for SRP and then the fact that SRP was sold
                              on 11 January 2018 (refer note 34). Management determined that any
                              equity accounted earnings for this short period that the group held
                              the investment in SRP would be immaterial.

                              </h4>
<p>The Group owns 50% of the ordinary shares in Atterbury Europe and
                              100% of the issued preference share capital of Atterbury Europe which
                              did not hold any voting rights. The investment in the preference shares
                              is classified as part of the Group's net investment in Atterbury Europe
                              together with the 50% investment in the ordinary shares. The requirement
                              to declare preference dividends is not mandatory, the preference shares
                              have no fixed terms of repayment and are unsecured. The investment
                              in the preference shares is therefore deemed akin to an equity investment.

                              investments during the period
                              </h4>
<p>During the period the Group increased its preference share investment
                              in Atterbury Europe by €278 million to support the expansion in central
                              and eastern Europe. The SRP investment was acquired for €159 million
                              in July 2017. Cofel SAS, a bedding manufacturer was subscribed for
                              during the period for €51 million. POCO was recognised as an equity
                              accounted investment on 31 March 2017 at fair value on initial recognition
                              of €302 million (refer note 1.2.3b for judgements regarding the recognition
                              of POCO as an equity accounted investment). The investment in POCO
                              was not acquired for cash, but was recognised as a result of a loss
                              of control.
                              </p>
<p>As part of the KAP rights offer, the Group subscribed for a further
                              94 million KAP shares during the period for €45 million.
                              </p>
<p>In the prior period the Group acquired its interest in the Bud
                              Group for €132 million and increased their preference share investment
                              in Atterbury Europe by €85 million.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">10.5 Significant
                              judgements relating to impairment of equity accounted investments
                              </h4>
<p>The Group considers whether any impairment indicators are present
                              with regards to its investment in equity accounted companies by reference
                              to the quoted fair value, if available, as well as the underlying
                              investment's profitability, access to operational funding and any
                              other factors that could impact the investment's ability to deliver
                              returns to the Group.
                              </p>
<p>The following investments had impairment indicators present and
                              considerations are discussed below.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">SRP</h4>
<p>As at 30 September 2017, SRP's share price had declined significantly
                              since the initial acquisition by the Group. The Group determined impairment
                              indicators were present as a result of the decline in the share price
                              driven by reduced profitability of SRP following several profit warnings
                              by the Group. The Group considered the recoverable amount of its investment
                              in SRP to be the fair value taking into account the listed share price,
                              and recognised an impairment of €79 million during the period.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Cofel SAS
                              and POCO
                              </h4>
<p>Cofel SAS and POCO showed impairment indicators of declining profitability
                              together with Cofel SAS's inability to pay dividends to ordinary shareholders
                              during the period.
                              </p>
<p>As Cofel SAS and POCO are private entities, EBITDA multiples were
                              applied based on available market information to determine a recoverable
                              amount for both Cofel SAS and POCO.
                              </p>
<p>An impairment of €46 million and €49 million was recognised during
                              the period for Cofel SAS and POCO, respectively.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Atterbury
                              Europe
                              </h4>
<p>The investment in Atterbury Europe was disposed of on a piecemeal
                              basis during 2018 to alleviate funding requirements of the Group.
                              A loss of €130 million was recognised on the disposal (refer to note
                              34). Management considered whether this loss recognised on disposal
                              during 2018 was indicative of any impairment indicators that existed
                              at the reporting date and concluded that an impairment at 30 September
                              2017 was not required. The Group invested in Atterbury Europe joint
                              venture to expand the Group's property presence in Eastern Europe.
                              A property portfolio of this size was intended to provide returns
                              in the long-term. The underlying assets (properties) in the Atterbury
                              Europe portfolio were not deemed to be impaired at 30 September 2017
                              and both joint venture partners had sufficient access to the funding
                              required to support the operations and expansion as at 30 September
                              2017. Management concluded that the sale of a long-term property investment
                              of this size on a piecemeal basis so soon after the initial investment
                              was made resulted in the loss on disposal.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">PSG</h4>
<p>In the prior year the quoted fair value of the PSG investment was
                              less than the carrying amount. A period-end sum-of-the-parts valuation
                              exceeded the carrying value of the Group's interest in PSG and the
                              investment was not deemed to be impaired.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">10.6 Commitments</h4>
<p>The Group's obligation in respect of losses and contingent liabilities
                              from equity accounted companies is limited to the extent of the carrying
                              values of the investments including loans and preference share investments.
                              </p>
<p>The Group's had committed funding of €15.8 million to Atterbury
                              Europe for development of properties during 2018. Subsequent to year-end,
                              with the disposal of Atterbury Europe, the Group was released of this
                              funding obligation.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">10.7 Summarised
                              information in respect of material equity accounted companies
                              </h4>
<p>The table below provides summarised financial information for those
                              equity accounted investments that are material to the Group. The information
                              disclosed reflects the amounts presented in the most recent financial
                              statements of the relevant equity accounted companies and not the
                              Group's share of those amounts.
                              </p>
<p>Adjustments are made for material transactions occurring between
                              equity accounted company's reporting date and Steinhoff N.V.'s reporting
                              date (where necessary).
                              </p>
<p>Where relevant the statements of financial positions of the associates
                              were translated to Euro at spot conversion rate at the end of the
                              Group's reporting period and the income statements were translated
                              to Euro at the average conversion rate applicable to the Group's financial
                              year.
                              </p>
<p>The Group has compared the accounting policies of these companies
                              to those of the Group and has found no material differences that require
                              adjustment.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Classification
                              of trade and other receivables
                              </h4>
<p>Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold
                              or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Loans and
                              other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
                              determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If
                              collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less they are
                              classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current
                              assets. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within
                              30 to 90 days and therefore are all classified as current.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Supplier bonuses</h4>
<p>Supplier bonuses are recognised as a reduction in expenses when
                              certain targets are met. The bonuses are mostly contractual in nature
                              and are dependent upon meeting certain volume targets.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Other receivables</h4>
<p>Included in other amounts due are creditors with debit balances,
                              insurance receivables and various other receivables.
                              </p>

                              </h4>
<p>Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently
                              measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
                              provision for impairment.
                              </p>
<p>Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their
                              carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.
                              For the majority of the non-current receivables, the fair values are
                              also not significantly different from their carrying amounts.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Derivatives</h4>
<p>Refer to note 18 and 19 for details regarding the determination
                              of their fair values and the types of derivatives, respectively.

<p>In terms of the proposed European restructuring detailed in the
                              Lock-Up Agreement, dated 28 November 2018, the SEAG CVA and the SFHG
                              CVA were filed with the English court. The SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA
                              seek to implement the restructuring plan outlined in the Lock-Up Agreement.
                              </p>
<p>The total amount of such external European debt instruments under
                              the CVA is approximately €7.9 billion, being approximately €5.2 billion
                              of external SEAG debt and approximately €2.7 billion of external SFHG
                              debt.
                              </p>
<p>On 29 March 2019, the Company announced that the requisite majority
                              of creditors of SEAG and SFHG had provided their consent to the extension
                              of the CVA long-stop date to 31 May 2019. The approval consequently
                              extended the long-stop date as defined in and as applicable to the
                              Lock-Up Agreement to be the same as the extended CVA long-stop date.
                              </p>
<p>The SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA seek, amongst others, to revise the
                              terms of the Group's principal European debt instruments, and the
                              guarantees of such instruments, to provide a common set of covenants
                              and security package and a maturity date set sufficiently in advance,
                              being 31 December 2021. At the date of publication of the consolidated
                              financial statements, not all of the remaining conditions in relation
                              to the SEAG CVA and the SFHG CVA have been satisfied. Refer to note
                              34.

<p>The Hemisphere Lock-Up Agreement was entered into by approximately
                              90% in value of the Hemisphere lenders and became effective on 26
                              July 2018. The restructuring of the financial indebtedness of Hemisphere
                              was implemented on 5 September 2018. This resulted in a new, secured,
                              three-year term loan facility of approximately €775 million at Hemisphere.
                              Since then, following the sale of kika-Leiner property companies and
                              certain other individual assets, approximately €473 million has been
                              applied in repayment of interest and principal of this facility by
                              Hemisphere leaving a balance owing of approximately €324 million.
                              The Hemisphere property portfolio serve as security for this facility.
                              </p>
<p>In anticipation of Mattress Firm filing for Chapter 11, Mattress
                              Firm had access to approximately $250 million in debtorin-possession
                              financing to support its ongoing operations during the Chapter 11
                              cases. On emergence from Chapter 11, Mattress Firm had access to a
                              four-year exit facility term loan in the original principal amount
                              of $400 million, a portion of which was used to repay the debtor-in-possession
                              facilities, and an exit asset backed lending facility in the amount
                              of $125 million. In accordance with the terms of the exit facilities,
                              the exit facility lenders received their pro rata share of 49.9% of
                              the equity in SUSHI the owner of Mattress Firm. The Group retaining
                              a 50.1% equity interest in SUSHI. These shareholdings are however
                              in each case subject to dilution by a management incentive plan. As
                              part of the restructuring, the Mattress Firm sub-group was moved within
                              the Group structure from directly below the Company to become a subsidiary
                              of SEAG. This move facilitated the restructuring of certain material
                              intercompany loans owed by SUSHI and the Mattress Firm Group. In relation
                              to their equity stake, the exit facility lenders and the Group executed
                              a stockholders' agreement that governs, among other things, shareholder
                              rights in relation to the governance of SUSHI and sales of their respective
                              equity interests. The exit facility lenders also receive a $150 million
                              payment-in-kind facility that has a five-year maturity.
                              </p>
<p>Certain operating companies also raised their own external funding
                              subsequent to year-end. Refer to note 34 for further details.
                              </p>
<p>As such the Group's debt profile changed significantly since 30
                              September 2017, and disclosure of details around the 30 September
                              2017 debt balances is not considered relevant.

<p>This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining
                              the fair values of the financial instruments that are recognised and
                              measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. To
                              provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in
                              determining fair value, the Group has classified its financial instruments
                              into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards.
                              </p>
<p>Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active
                              markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and listed equities
                              and available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices
                              at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for
                              financial assets held by the Group is a 30-day volume weighted average
                              price. These instruments are included in level 1.

<p>Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded
                              in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
                              determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable
                              market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
                              If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are
                              observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
                              </p>
<p>Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based
                              on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
                              This is the case for unlisted equity securities.

<p>The fair value calculation of the financial assets and liabilities
                              was performed at the reporting date. Between the reporting date and
                              the date of this report, the fair values reported may have fluctuated
                              with changing market conditions and therefore the fair values are

                              in the normal course of business after the reporting date.

                              value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (level 3)
                              </h4>
<p>The most material level 3 investment relates to the 17% investment
                              in the Steinhoff Sikhulasonke Employee scheme ("SSI"). SSI holds Steinhoff
                              shares and has preference share funding through external parties and
                              the Group. The underlying asset being the Steinhoff shares was valued
                              using the listed 30 day VWAP and the unobservable inputs relate to
                              the expected cash outflows of the repayment of the preference share
                              as well as certain expenses within the scheme. The Group calculated
                              the value of its 17% investment as a share in the underlying net asset
                              value of the SSI structure together with the amortised cost of its
                              preference share funding.
                              </p>
<p>This investment was realised subsequent to year-end. Refer note
                              34.

<p>The finance department of the Group performs the valuations of
                              non-property items required for financial reporting purposes, including
                              level 3 fair values. Discussions of valuation processes and results
                              are held between the CFO, and the team at least once every three months,
                              in line with the Group's quarterly reporting periods.

                              risk management
                              </h4>
<p>During both periods under review, the Group had various committees
                              and departments that were tasked with the financial risk management
                              of the Group. In most instances this was successfully managed at the
                              various operating company levels.
                              </p>
<p>However, the investigation revealed a number of short comings relating
                              to the Group's overall financial risk management as a result of the
                              override of the internal controls, by certain senior key management
                              personnel of the Group.
                              </p>
<p>The Management and Supervisory Boards are cognisant of the fact
                              that the risk management processes in place did not address the financial
                              risks faced by the Group as a result of the material irregularities
                              and events that occurred in December 2017. The Management and Supervisory
                              Boards have focused their attention on implementing more stringent
                              internal controls and improved processes relating to the Group's financial
                              risk management processes. Details of this is outlined in the Remediation
                              Plan in the Management Board Report.
                              </p>
<p>This note explains the Group's exposure to financial risks and
                              how these risks could affect the Group's future financial performance,
                              where this remains relevant, as at the end of each reporting period.
                              The processes outlined in this note are the risk management strategies
                              that were in place during the period regardless of their effectiveness
                              in addressing the risks faced by the Group. Current period profit
                              and loss information has been included where relevant to add further

<p>The Management Board was responsible, during the Reporting Period,
                              for implementing the risk management strategy, to ensure that an appropriate
                              risk management framework was operating effectively across the Group.
                              The Board and the Audit and Risk Committee were provided with a consolidated
                              view of the risk profile of the Group, and any major exposures and
                              relevant mitigating actions identified.
                              </p>
<p>During the periods under review, the Group's risk management was
                              carried out by a central treasury department (group treasury). Group
                              treasury identified, evaluated and hedged financial risks in close
                              co-operation with the Group's operating units. The Board and Group
                              treasury had agreed policies, covering specific areas such as foreign
                              exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments
                              and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess
                              liquidity.
                              </p>
<p>The system of risk management was designed so that the different
                              business units were able to tailor and adapt their risk management
                              processes to suit their specific circumstances.
                              </p>
<p>The ongoing management of both solvency and liquidity risk remains
                              a primary concern and focus for the Group. Due to the uncertainties
                              surrounding the extent of the irregularities, the lack of the consolidated
                              financial statements, and the outcome of the forensic investigation,
                              financial creditors withdrew all available banking facilities and/or
                              removed credit facilities subsequent to the reporting date. The effects
                              include, but are not limited to, limited ability to maintain or open
                              banking facilities, limited and, in most instances, no hedging facilities,
                              and cancellation of suppliers' credit insurance resulting in a dramatic
                              increase in supplier credit facilities.

<p>The Group applies hyperinflation accounting in line with the requirements

                              </h4>
<p>Given the Group's global footprint and its strategy of low-cost
                              manufacturing and sourcing in emerging markets and sales in developed
                              countries, the Group follows a policy of maintaining a balance between
                              fixed and variable rate loans to reflect, as accurately as possible,
                              different interest rate environments, the stability of the relevant
                              currencies, the effect which the relevant interest rates have on group
                              operations and consumer spending within these environments. These
                              variables are taken into account in structuring the Group's borrowings
                              to achieve a reasonable, competitive, market-related cost of funding.
                              </p>
<p>As part of the process of managing the Group's borrowings mix,
                              the interest rate characteristics of new borrowings and the refinancing
                              of existing borrowings are positioned according to expected movements
                              in interest rates. Interest rate exposure is managed within limits
                              agreed by the Management Board.
                              </p>
<p>The Group's borrowings and receivables are carried at amortised
                              cost.
                              </p>
<p>The Group continued to manage its interest rate exposure by maintaining
                              a mix of fixed and floating interest rates. This was done by direct
                              fixed or floating interest rate debt issues at the time of refinance
                              or when obtaining new borrowings, based on the mix of floating and
                              fixed interest rate of existing borrowings and management's expectations
                              of future interest rate movements. All treasury transactions were
                              undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying activities
                              and no speculative trading was undertaken.
                              </p>
<p>The interest and related terms of the Group's borrowings are disclosed
                              in note 16.

<p>Refer to note 1.2.3d for the origin of this loan. The Brait listed

                              A 1% movement in the 30 day VWAP used for Brait would result in an
                              adjustment on the loan value to profit or loss of €1 million in 2017
                              (30 Day VWAP: ZAR56.24) and €1.8 million through other comprehensive

<p>Potential concentration of credit risk consists principally of
                              short-term cash and cash equivalent investments, trade and other receivables,

                              with major banks of quality credit standing. Trade receivables comprise
                              a large and widespread customer base and group companies perform ongoing
                              credit evaluations on the financial condition of their customers,
                              and appropriate use is made of credit guarantee insurance. At 30 September
                              2017, the Group did not consider there to be any significant concentration
                              of credit risk which had not been adequately provided for. The amounts
                              presented in the statement of financial position are net of provisions
                              for bad debts, estimated by the Group companies' management based
                              on prior experience and the current economic environment.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Impairment
                              of assets carried at amortised cost
                              </h4>
<p>For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as
                              the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present
                              value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses
                              that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original
                              effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced
                              and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. If a loan
                              or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount
                              rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest
                              rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the
                              Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument's fair
                              value using an observable market price.
                              </p>
<p>If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases
                              and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring
                              after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the
                              debtor's credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised
                              impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are
                              written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. The other receivables
                              are assessed collectively to determine whether there is objective
                              evidence that an impairment has been incurred but not yet been identified.
                              For these receivables the estimated impairment losses are recognised
                              in a separate provision for impairment.
                              </p>
<p>The Group considers that there is evidence of impairment if any
                              of the following indicators are present:

<p>Receivables for which an impairment provision was recognised are
                              written off against the provision when there is no expectation of
                              recovering additional cash. Impairment losses are recognised in profit
                              or loss within other expenses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
                              written off are credited against other expenses.
                              </p>

<p>The Group has liens over items sold until full payment has been
                              received from customers. The fair value of collateral held against
                              these loans and receivables is linked to the value of the liens. Furthermore,
                              the group has credit insurance to cover its exposure to risk on receivables.
                              </p>
<p>The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain
                              impaired assets and are not past due. Based on the credit history
                              of these other classes, it is expected that these amounts will be
                              received when due. Other than mentioned above the Group does not hold
                              any collateral in relation to these receivables.

                              </h4>
<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty
                              in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities.
                              Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the entity could
                              be required to pay its liabilities earlier than expected.
                              </p>
<p>The Group in the year under review managed liquidity risk by monitoring
                              forecast cash flows and by ensuring that adequate borrowing facilities
                              were available. Cash surpluses and short-term financing needs of manufacturing
                              and sales companies were mainly centralised in African and European
                              central offices. These central treasury offices invested net cash
                              reserves on the financial markets, mainly in short-term instruments
                              linked to variable interest rates.

<p>The Group is in technical breach of all its financial covenants
                              and therefore no longer has access to any undrawn borrowing facilities.
                              Refer to note 16.4 and 19.5.

<p>The Group has recalculated its financial covenant calculations

                              30 September 2016.
                              </p>
<p>The Group breached the financial statement covenant subsequent
                              to year-end due to the late publication of most of the Group's financial
                              statements.

<p>Due to various guarantees and cross-guarantees issued by various
                              companies within the Group, every borrowing listed in note 16 is immediately
                              repayable as a result of the breach of the financial covenants and
                              therefore classified as current.
                              </p>
<p>No remedies or renegotiation of terms were finalised before the
                              end of the reporting period. The Group renegotiated the terms of all
                              the borrowings with financial creditors during 2018 and the terms
                              of the Lock-Up Agreement were finalised after the end of the reporting
                              period but before the consolidated financial statements were issued.

                              </h4>
<p>The leave obligations cover the Group's liability for annual leave.</p>
<p>The leave obligations relates to vesting leave pay to which employees
                              may become entitled on leaving the employment of the Group. The accrual
                              arises as employees render a service that increases their entitlement
                              to future compensated leave and is calculated based on an employee's
                              total cost of employment. The accrual is utilised when employees become
                              entitled to and are paid for the accumulated leave or utilise compensated
                              leave due to them. The entire amount of the provision is presented
                              as current, since the Group does not have an unconditional right to
                              defer settlement for any of these obligations. However, based on past
                              experience, the Group does not expect all employees to take the full
                              amount of accrued leave or require payment within the next 12 months.
                              Leave that is expected to be taken or paid within the next 12 months
                              amounted to €60 million (2016: €62 million).

                              once the performance bonuses have been approved by management. As
                              the approval by management takes place after period end, an amount
                              is accrued based on a probability of the employee having achieved
                              their performance targets and the amount is estimated based on the
                              relative bonus structures in place. The payment of such performance
                              bonus is conditional upon the continuing employment of the employee.
                              Any amounts not approved by management or upon termination of employment
                              are reversed in the subsequent periods.

<p>Provisions (except for contingent liabilities recognised in terms
                              of IFRS 3) are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive
                              obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow
                              of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount
                              can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
                              operating losses.
                              </p>
<p>Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood
                              that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
                              the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even
                              if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included
                              in the same class of obligations may be small.
                              </p>
<p>Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best
                              estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation
                              at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine
                              the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments
                              of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
                              The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised
                              as interest expense.

                              onerous lease and onerous contract provisions
                              </h4>
<p>A contract is considered onerous when the unavoidable costs of
                              meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits
                              expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract
                              reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is
                              the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties
                              arising from failure to fulfil it. Before a separate provision for
                              an onerous contract is established, any impairment loss that has occurred
                              on assets dedicated to that contract is recognised.

<p>Provision for dilapidation of buildings occupied by the Group and

                              terms of the contract are unfavourable, based on market-related rates.

<p>The warranty provision represents management's best estimate, based
                              on past experience, of the Group's liability under warranties granted
                              on products sold. These claims are expected to be settled within the
                              next 12 months.

<p>An agreement was reached during 2019 financial year relating to
                              a legal dispute with Pohlmann (refer to note 1.2.3b for origins of
                              the transaction). Management considered this to be an adjusting subsequent
                              event and an amount under a confidential settlement and relevant withholding
                              taxes have been provided for during the 2017 financial period.
                              </p>
<p>A payment of €147 million made to Seifert in December 2016 relating

                              </p>
<p>The remainder of the legal claims provision balance relates to
                              various immaterial legal claims.

                              liabilities raised on business combinations
                              </h4>
<p>IFRS 3 requires certain contingent liabilities of the acquiree
                              to be recognised and measured in a business combination at acquisition
                              date fair value. Therefore, contrary to IAS 37: Provision, Contingent
                              Liabilities and Contingent Assets, the acquirer recognises a contingent
                              liability assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date
                              even if it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
                              be required to settle the obligation. This provision includes amounts
                              for possible supplier settlements, customer claims and legal disputes.
                              Refer to note 24 for details of business combinations.

<p>Other provisions include all amounts where there is a present obligation
                              as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of
                              economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions
                              are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to
                              be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects
                              current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
                              specific to the obligation.

                              have filed a further complaint against AIH and SEAG with LSW requesting
                              the repayment of a loan granted to SEAG and AIH in the amount of €299.9
                              million and interest in the amount of €29.4 million ("the Loan Proceedings").
                              SEAG and AIH have filed an answer to the complaint and contested the
                              relief requested by LSW in its entirety. In addition, LSW requested
                              solely from SEAG financing costs in the amount of €58.9 million as
                              well as default interest on the amount of €388.3 million at a rate
                              of 5.14% per annum above the 6-months-EURIBOR since 12 October 2015.
                              LSW initially requested €388.3 million plus interest and the costs
                              of the proceedings from SEAG and €329.3 million plus costs of the
                              proceedings from AIH.
                              </p>
<p>On 21 December 2016, LSW received an amount of €146.7 million
                              from Steinhoff entities. LSW reduced its claim on 17 February 2017
                              to €265.4 million (plus interest at a rate of 5.14% per annum above
                              the 6-months-EURIBOR from 22 December 2016) vis-a-vis SEAG and €249.2
                              million vis-a-vis AIH, plus costs of the proceedings from both parties.
                              </p>
<p>On 20 July 2018 and again on 20 September 2018, LSW filed for
                              a preliminary injunction against SEAG and AIH in order to secure its
                              claim arising from the Loan Proceedings. The competent judge of the
                              Loan Proceedings rejected LSW's application(s) for a preliminary injunction
                              on all alleged grounds with his decision dated 1 October 2018.
                              </p>
<p class="list_p_l">The Loan Proceedings are ongoing and SEAG and AIH continue to
                              oppose the relief sought by LSW.

                              paid in cash. The acquisition has significantly increased the Group's
                              market share in Australia and complements the Group's existing furniture
                              retail business in Australia.

                              for dilapidations. Deferred taxation was provided on all the relevant
                              adjustments.

                              rights of Tekkie Town for a purchase price of €226 million (ZAR3.4
                              billion). The acquisition has significantly increased the Group's
                              market share in footwear in South Africa, and complements the Group's
                              existing speciality business in the general merchandise retail sector.
                              </p>
<p>The purchase price was partially settled by Steinhoff issuing approximately
                              25 million Steinhoff shares and a cash amount of €108 million. The
                              fair value of the shares issued as part of the consideration paid
                              for Tekkie Town (€118 million) was based on the 30 day VWAP on 31
                              January 2017 of ZAR69.39 per share. Refer to note 30 for details regarding
                              the special purpose vehicle established to facilitate this transaction.
                              </p>
<p>The material fair value adjustments relate to the recognition of
                              the Tekkie Town brand. Deferred taxation was provided at capital rates
                              as the brand was assessed to have an indefinite useful life.
                              </p>
<p>Revenue of €61 million and net profit after taxation of €7 million

<p>The fair value of assets and liabilities assumed of Tekkie Town

<p>Treasury shares are recognised as equity when Group companies (including

                              reacquires its own shares, or when the Company shares are under the
                              control of the Group through unconsolidated structured entities (refer
                              note 1.2). The amount of the consideration paid, including directly
                              attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. When treasury
                              shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised
                              as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on
                              the transaction is transferred to/from share premium or accumulated

<p>Bonds which are convertible to share capital, where the number
                              of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value,
                              are accounted for as compound financial instruments. Transaction costs
                              that relate to the issue of a compound financial instrument are allocated
                              to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation
                              of the proceeds. The equity component of the convertible bonds is
                              calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the present value
                              of the future interest and principal payments, discounted at the market

                              or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes

                              operation, while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
                              cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When
                              the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate
                              or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining
                              significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of
                              the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.

<p>Preference shares classified as equity are attributable to shareholders
                              other than the Company shareholders. These preference shares are therefore
                              attributable to non-controlling interests of the Group and are classified
                              as a component of equity attributable to non-controlling interests.
                              </p>
<p>The voting and participation rights of preference shareholders
                              differ to those of non-controlling ordinary equity shareholders. Preference
                              shareholders do not share in the underlying net asset value of the
                              various businesses and have no voting rights except in certain instances.
                              </p>
<p>Preference shares are therefore presented as a separate component
                              of non-controlling interests within equity.

<p>When the Group ceases to consolidate an investment because of a
                              loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured
                              to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in
                              profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount
                              for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest
                              as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any
                              amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect
                              of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed
                              of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously
                              recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit
                              or loss.
                              </p>
<p>If the Group retains no interest, the carrying value of the non-controlling
                              interest is disposed and forms part of the net asset value of the
                              investment upon disposal. The difference between the proceeds received
                              and the net asset value disposed is recognised in profit or loss.

                              </h4>
<p>The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that
                              do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity owners
                              of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment
                              between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling
                              interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any
                              difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling
                              interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised in
                              a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Group.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Pepkor</h4>
<p>Pepkor (previously STAR) was listed on the JSE on 20 September
                              2017 at which date the non-controlling interests were introduced.
                              The Group did not lose control of Pepkor as a result of this transaction.
                              </p>
<p>The carrying amount of net asset value sold to non-controlling
                              interest amounted to €764 million and proceeds of €1 billion were
                              recovered from the non-controlling interests. The excess of the proceeds
                              received was recognised in equity.

<p>Control of POCO was lost on 31 March 2017. The remaining 50% equity
                              interest was recognised as an equity accounted investment. Refer note
                              1.2.3b and note 10. The carrying value of the non-controlling interest
                              of POCO of €199 million was derecognised on the date control was lost.
                              The excess of the carrying value of the net asset value and the consideration
                              paid in previous periods relating to POCO amounted to €115 million.
                              The full balance was transferred to accumulated losses upon loss of
                              control of POCO during the current period.

                              a result of the substance over form treatment of all the brands and

<p>Christo Wiese was previously a non-independent, non-executive Supervisory
                              Board director and Chairman of the Group and considered to be key
                              management personnel of the Group up until December 2017. Due to the
                              extent of the historical transactions entered into with entities under
                              Christo Wiese's influence, management considered whether any of these
                              entities should have been consolidated by the Group. Management has,
                              however, concluded that the Group at no point controlled any of these
                              entities because of its relationship with Christo Wiese. Instances
                              of deficient disclosure in the Group's historical consolidated financial
                              statements were identified, with relation to transactions entered
                              into between the Group and Christo Wiese. These disclosure deficiencies
                              are in terms of transactions entered into with Christo Wiese, that
                              were not previously presented as transactions with a related party.

<p>Based on information available and management's understanding of
                              the various transactions entered into by the Group, management assessed
                              the following entities, and their subsidiaries, to be material related
                              entities to the Group by virtue of Christo Wiese or his close family

                              Visas for themselves and their families. Conforama received proceeds
                              to the amount of €7 million. This value approximates the net book
                              value of the property on the date of the sale. The price was determined
                              by consulting with external valuation experts and is deemed to be
                              market related. Each of the executives raised their own funding to

                              purposes. The rental is considered to be below market, therefore benefitting

                              in Habufa. Loan agreements indicate Hachmer granted a loan of up to
                              £50 million to Mayfair Holdings Proprietary Limited ("Mayfair") on
                              6 December 2016, whose ultimate shareholder was a family trust of
                              Markus Jooste. A back-to-back loan agreement was entered into between
                              Hachmer and Formal Holdings Limited ("Formal") (a company affiliated
                              with a business partner of Markus Jooste). The investment in Hachmer

                              partner in Habufa) in December 2016. Mayfair Speculators Proprietary
                              Limited ("Mayfair Speculators"), a direct subsidiary of Mayfair, assumed
                              the obligation owing to Hachmer on 10 November 2017. Management of
                              Hachmer did not recognise the loans at the time the loans were expected
                              to have been granted as no cash flowed via Hachmer, despite the loan
                              agreements concluded. Given that Hachmer was a related party of the
                              Group at the time the loan was allegedly granted the transaction has
                              been disclosed. As Hachmer was disposed by the Group, the alleged
                              loan is not included in any Group results.

<p>Management assessed the upstream and downstream transactions between
                              Group companies and equity accounted companies. Inventory turnover
                              of stock items purchased is relatively fast and therefore no material
                              inventory is on hand at period end that should be eliminated. The
                              remaining transactions are related to services which are recognised
                              as they are delivered and therefore no further eliminations are required.

<p>The Group identified entities with which material transactions
                              occurred, but were not assessed to be related parties in terms of
                              IAS 24. Control assessments have been performed on these entities
                              in accordance with IFRS 10. Key elements considered during these assessments
                              were the Group's right to variable returns from the investee, the
                              Group's ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee
                              and the Group's ability to use its power to affect the returns from
                              its involvement from the investee.
                              </p>
<p>Management considered the nature and quantum of the transactions
                              with these affiliated parties and have provided voluntary disclosure,
                              where management deem it relevant, in this note.
                              </p>
<p>Refer to note 1.2, note 4 and note 11 for critical judgements relating
                              to the Campion, Talgarth and Fihag Groups. The transactions with these
                              groups are presented in this note.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgement</h4>
<p>IAS 24 provides guidance in identifying related parties and transactions
                              with related parties. Management have applied the requirements of
                              IAS 24 in understanding the relationships with various ostensibly
                              independent third parties. Management have used all available information
                              to assess whether entities within the four principal groups that were
                              not consolidated, are related parties, when applying the principles
                              of IAS 24. Management concluded that such entities did not meet the
                              definition of a related party. Where information procured suggests
                              that transactions with such affiliated parties are on a non-arm's
                              length basis, management have provided disclosure thereof.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgement</h4>
<p>Refer to note 1.2.5a regarding the origins of these transactions.
                              There remains uncertainty with respect to the relevant activities
                              of these entities, which are part of the Campion Group, which could
                              extend beyond transactions with the Group, although it appears that
                              the purpose of the entities was to hold Steinhoff shares. There is
                              insufficient evidence to suggest that the Group can control the activities
                              of the entities in the absence of holding voting rights. The Group
                              is exposed to variable returns from SSUK as a result of funding provided,
                              although it is noted a loan agreement was only put in place after
                              the repayment of the first loan that was granted. Subsequent loans
                              were not covered by this agreement and therefore lacked economic substance.
                              Management has concluded that the Group does not control these entities.
                              Despite not consolidating these entities, the Steinhoff shares held
                              by SSUK were recognised as treasury shares, together with the related
                              share-based payments arising from transactions with these entities.
                              Refer to note 1.2.5a and note 32.2 for share-based payment expenses
                              relating to the share funding transactions.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgement</h4>
<p>Town Investments was established with assistance of the Group in
                              order to acquire Steinhoff shares. There is insufficient evidence
                              to suggest that the Group can control the activities of Town Investments
                              in the absence of holding voting rights despite indicators of control.
                              The Group is also exposed to variable returns arising from the loan
                              funding provided to acquire the shares.
                              </p>
<p>Management has concluded that it should therefore not consolidate
                              Town Investments but has accounted for the transaction entered into
                              with Town investments in order to reflect the substance of the transaction
                              and the Group's exposure. Since the only assets held by Town Investments
                              are the shares in Steinhoff, the repayment of the loan to Steinhoff
                              is dependent on the performance of the underlying Steinhoff shares.
                              Steinhoff is therefore exposed to negative returns from Town Investments
                              in respect of the funding it has provided, and the third party shareholders
                              of Town Investments are exposed to possible upside to the extent the
                              value of the Steinhoff shares exceeds the funding provided by Steinhoff.
                              In substance, such a structure is akin to Steinhoff issuing a call
                              option on its own shares, and a share-based payment expense should
                              therefore be recognised. Despite not consolidating this entity management
                              have recognised the Steinhoff shares held by Town Investments as treasury
                              shares and recognised the related share-based payment expense. The
                              loan to Town Investments remains recognised as treasury shares until
                              such time as the loan is repaid by exercising the in-substance option.
                              </p>
<p>The share-based payment expense recognised amounted to €4.1 million
                              during the 2017 financial reporting period. Refer to note 4.2.5 and
                              note 32.2 for the share-based payment expenses relating to the share
                              funding transactions.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Geros</h4>
<p>Geros FS, a subsidiary of Geros B, a subsidiary of Fihag at some
                              point in time, acquired two debtors books and a 70% interest in Blake
                              and Associate Holdings Proprietary Limited ("Blake") from the Group
                              for ZAR300 million and ZAR163.1 million respectively during 2013.
                              The acquisition was funded by the Group through the Group's loan to
                              Top Global whereby Top Global advanced a loan to Geros B, to the value
                              of €31.6 million (ZAR450.3 million). No formal loan agreements have
                              been identified.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgement</h4>
<p>Management also considered whether it controlled Geros B and Geros
                              FS. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the Group can control
                              the activities of the entities in the absence of holding voting rights.
                              Management have considered the nature of their relationship with Geros
                              B and Geros FS and have concluded that the Group does not control
                              these entities as it does not have the power to affect the variable
                              returns, despite the Group's exposure to variable returns as a result
                              of funding provided. No formal funding agreements with Top Global
                              or the Fihag Group have been identified and therefore the loan was
                              deemed irrecoverable and fully impaired.
                              </p>
<p>Management also considered whether it controlled Fihag. Although
                              there are some indicators suggesting Steinhoff might control Fihag
                              since it indirectly facilitated certain transactions on behalf of
                              the Group and the Group was exposed to funding provided indirectly
                              to Fihag through its loan to Top Global, no conclusive information
                              exists to confirm that Steinhoff does in fact control Fihag. In addition,
                              management does not have access to the financial information of Fihag
                              to be able to consolidate it. Management therefore accounted for the
                              transactions involving Fihag to reflect the substance of the underlying
                              transactions and Group's exposure.

                              share scheme
                              </h4>
<p>The Company implemented a long term employee share right scheme
                              (the "ESRS"). Following the Scheme of Arrangement, Steinhoff N.V.
                              assumed the obligations to grant future share rights to share scheme
                              participants relating to grants of 1 December 2014.
                              </p>
<p>The purpose of the ESRS was to attract and retain key executives
                              and senior employees who are able to influence the performance of
                              the Group, on a basis which aligns the interests of such employees
                              with those of the Group, the relevant employer company and the Company's
                              shareholders.
                              </p>
<p>At grant date the employee has a right to the shares ("share rights")
                              on the vesting date. The amount of shares that will vest depends on
                              whether the employee met the performance criteria as determined by
                              the Remcom. Vesting is also at the discretion of the Remcom.
                              </p>
<p>The employee share plan is equity-settled.</p>
<p>The ESRS is subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>a) Rights are granted to qualifying senior executives on an annual
                              basis.
                              </p>
<p>b) Vesting of rights occur on the third anniversary of grant date,
                              provided performance criteria, as set by Remcom at or about the time
                              of the grant date, have been achieved.
                              </p>
<p>c) In the event of performance criteria not being satisfied by
                              the third anniversary of the relevant annual grant, all rights attaching
                              to the particular grant lapse.
                              </p>
<p>The following performance criteria were set by the Remcom::</p>
<p>a) The employee's participation in the share scheme will be subject
                              to the financial performance of the Group and the employer, cumulatively
                              over the 3 year period (the "measurement period");
                              </p>
<p>b) It is required that the employee qualify for participation,
                              on a cumulative basis, in the annual incentive bonus scheme as administered
                              by its employer in respect of the measurement period; and
                              </p>
<p>c) The employee having met its key performance indicators over
                              the measurement period.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Equity-settlement</h4>
<p>The fair value of the deferred delivery shares and the share rights
                              granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a
                              corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant
                              date and is expensed over the period during which the employees are
                              required to provide services, in order to become unconditionally entitled
                              to the equity instruments. The fair value of the instruments granted
                              is measured using generally accepted valuation techniques, taking
                              into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments are
                              granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect
                              the actual number of deferred delivery shares and the share rights
                              that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not
                              achieving the threshold for vesting.
                              </p>
<p>Considering the Group's restated results, management revised previous
                              estimates of the number of shares that will ultimately vest for each
                              open grant. Management's revised estimate is that it is highly unlikely
                              that any further shares will vest under any open grants. All expenses
                              arising from open grants were therefore reversed in prior periods.
                              Also refer note 1.2.6.
                              </p>
<p>Total expenses arising from the equity-settled employee share-based
                              payments of €nil (2016: €17 million) were recognised in profit or
                              loss as part of employee benefit expense. Refer to note 4.3.3.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Cash-settlement</h4>

<p>The fair value of services received in return for share rights

                              granted. The estimated fair value of the services received is measured
                              based on the assumption that all vesting conditions are met and all
                              employees remain in service. The pricing model used was the Monte
                              Carlo simulation. The volatility was estimated using the the Company's
                              daily closing share price over a rolling three-year period.

<p>The Group supported several entities in acquiring Steinhoff shares
                              via loan funding in the past. Where the acquisition of Steinhoff shares
                              is funded with a loan from the Group, that has no recourse to any
                              asset other than those shares, the borrower does not carry the risk
                              of a decline in the share price. The borrower will only benefit from
                              any increase in the share price above the loan balance, and therefore,
                              the borrower's exposure is effectively the same as a purchased call
                              option on the shares.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Critical judgement</h4>
<p>The substance of an arrangement as described above, is that the
                              Group has issued a call option on its own shares to the borrower,
                              requiring a share-based payment expense (with a corresponding increase
                              in equity) based on the fair value of the goods or services received,
                              or the fair value of the equity instruments granted. In addition,
                              the loan granted to the borrower is recognised as a debit to equity
                              (i.e. treasury shares held by agents), and the funded shares are only
                              treated as issued share capital once the related loan funding has
                              been settled.

<p>SSUK received 2.974.050 Steinhoff capitalisation shares during
                              2016 due to their shareholding in the Group.
                              </p>
<p>The Group repurchased 152 million of the Steinhoff shares at market
                              value on 29 September 2016 and immediately sold the Steinhoff shares
                              to Upington for the same value in cash.
                              </p>
<p>As mentioned above, in substance, such a structure is akin to the
                              Group issuing a call option on its own shares, and an equity-settled
                              share-based payment expense should therefore be recognised on the
                              loan grant date. In addition, since the abovementioned shares were
                              considered to be subject to a call option, the funding advance to
                              SSUK was recognised as a debit to treasury shares during the 2016
                              financial period until the option expired on 29 September 2016. The
                              in-substance option matured when the loan was settled. Refer to note
                              26 for the impact on the number and weighting of the treasury shares
                              during the period. Since it was not possible for the Group to directly
                              determine the fair value of the goods or services derived from the
                              share purchase and funding transaction, the fair value was indirectly
                              measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments
                              granted. Refer to below for the valuation inputs applied in determining
                              the fair value of the equity instruments granted.

                              </h4>
<p>The result of the 152 million share repurchase (as described above)
                              was that SSUK retained 974.050 Steinhoff shares, with an outstanding
                              loan balance of €3.8 million. Since SSUK retained none of the 150
                              million Steinhoff shares subject to the initial funding transaction,
                              the initial in-substance option is considered to have expired on 29
                              September 2016. The sharebased payment expense of €28.4 million was
                              released to retained earnings. However, since the Group is still exposed
                              to all the negative returns from SSUK regarding the remaining €3.8
                              million loan, and the third party shareholders of SSUK are only exposed
                              to possible upside to the extent that the value of the 974.050 Steinhoff
                              shares exceeds the funding provided by the Group, the substance of
                              the result is that the Group issued another in-substance call option
                              to SSUK to obtain 974.050 shares for €3.8 million. An equity-settled
                              share-based payment expense should therefore be recognised on this
                              date. In addition, since the 974.050 shares are considered to be subject
                              to a call option, the remainder of the funding advanced to SSUK is
                              recognised as a debit to treasury shares until the option is exercised.

                              additional 16.1 million Steinhoff shares in the open market. Similar
                              to the considerations already mentioned in this note, the substance
                              of such an arrangement is considered to be akin to the granting of
                              a call option on Steinhoff shares. An equity-settled share-based payment

                              addition, since the above-mentioned shares are considered to be subject
                              to a call option, the funding advanced to SSUK is recognised as a

<p>Refer to note 30 for details regarding the origin of the transaction.</p>
<p>Based on the information obtained from management's further investigations
                              into the transaction, it appears as if the introduction of Town Investments'
                              shareholding into the structure lacked commercial substance.
                              </p>
<p>The only assets held by Town Investments is the Steinhoff shares,
                              and the repayment of the loan to the Group is therefore dependent
                              on the performance of the underlying Steinhoff shares. Similar to
                              the considerations already mentioned in this note, the substance of
                              this arrangement is considered to be akin to the granting of a call
                              option on Steinhoff shares. An equity-settled share-based payment
                              expense should therefore be recognised on grant date of the loan.
                              In addition, since the above-mentioned shares are considered to be
                              subject to a call option, the funding advanced to Town Investments
                              is recognised as a debit to treasury shares until the option is exercised.

                              dependent, and would have been settled within one year. If management
                              assessed the options likely to be exercised ten years from the grant
                              date, the impact would have resulted in an additional share-based
                              payment expense of approximately €16.1 million.

                              and sensitivities relating to Town Investment (Refer note 32.2b)
                              </h4>
<p>Management believe repayment of the loan was likely to be made
                              once the Steinhoff share price was greater or equal to ZAR95 per share,
                              based on information available relating to the deal. Historical share
                              trade history shows the intention to make profit in the short term
                              (either between one to five years). It is management's view that the
                              option is of a short term nature. However, due to the expected margin/growth
                              to be obtained in the share price compared to the issue price, a two
                              year term was deemed more appropriate. Had management chosen a ten
                              year term, an additional share-based payment expense of €3.6 million
                              (ZAR53 million) would have been recognised in profit or loss.

<p class="list_p_f">CVA process</p>
<p>The restructuring of the Group's existing
                              financial indebtedness continues. On 30 November 2018, two of the
                              subsidiaries with most of the Group's financial creditors, SEAG and
                              SFHG, launched CVAs. The CVAs seek to implement the restructuring
                              plan set out in the Lock-Up Agreement. The steps to be implemented
                              pursuant to each of the CVAs included amendments to the corporate
                              holding structure, revised corporate governance across the European
                              holding companies and the restructuring of the existing financial
                              indebtedness including the issuance of new debt by certain newly incorporated
                              Luxembourg companies.
                              </p>
<p>In particular, the restructuring steps to be implemented pursuant
                              to each of the CVAs seek:
                              </p>
<p>i. to revise the terms of the Group's principal European debt
                              instruments, and the guarantees of such debt instruments, to provide
                              a common set of covenants and security package and a maturity date
                              set sufficiently in advance (being 31 December 2021);
                              </p>
<p>ii. as a result of those maturity dates, to afford the Group the
                              opportunity to seek to improve the value of its assets for the benefit
                              of its creditors and avoid a situation whereby SEAG's and SFHG's assets
                              would be realised in a distressed scenario, potentially reducing any
                              returns to SEAG's or SFHG's creditors and other stakeholders;
                              </p>
<p>iii. through the revised debt terms, to improve the Group's liquidity
                              position by providing that the interest accruing on the new debt pursuant
                              to the restructuring will be payment-in-kind ("PIK"), rather than
                              in cash;
                              </p>
<p>iv. The PIK rate applicable to the New Lux Finco 1 Debt will be
                              10%. per annum. The PIK rates applicable to the New Lux Finco 2 Debt
                              will be:
                              </p>
<p>a. 10% per annum in relation to a "Super Senior Facility Loan";</p>
<p>b. 7.875% per annum in relation to a "Facility A1 Loan" or a "Facility
                              B1 Loan"; and
                              </p>
<p>c. 10.75% in relation to a "Facility A2 Loan" or a "Facility B2
                              Loan".
                              </p>
<p>Such PIK interest rates may increase in the event that certain
                              creditor approved nominees are not appointed to the Management Board
                              of Steinhoff N.V. in due course;
                              </p>
<p>v. The new SEAG debt facility contains provisions that regulate
                              the steps to be taken if the new SEAG HoldCo decides to undertake
                              a material asset disposal outside of a default scenario. If that material
                              asset disposal also requires a shareholder vote by the Company shareholders,
                              the matter will be put to the Company shareholders. If the Company
                              shareholders do not vote in favour of the sale there is a requirement
                              that within approximately 75 days the SEAG debt is prepaid in amount
                              equal to the net proceeds that would have been obtained on the proposed
                              sale. If the Company does not raise the required funds within the
                              required time to make the prepayment an event of default under the
                              new debt facilities will occur. For more details please refer to the
                              CVA proposals and the new SEAG finance documentation.
                              </p>
<p>vi. To implement (or provide the framework to implement) revised
                              corporate governance across the European holding companies in order
                              to supplement and support the functions and specifications of those
                              holding companies including the appointment of new directors to certain
                              companies within the SEAG Group and the establishment of a litigation
                              working group; and
                              </p>
<p>vii. The debt instruments contain numerous other events of default.
                              For more details please refer to the CVA Proposals and the new finance
                              documentation
                              </p>
<p>Meetings of the creditors and members of SEAG and SFHG were held
                              on 14 December 2018 at which the CVAs were approved by the requisite
                              majorities. Various conditions are to be satisfied prior to implementation
                              of the restructuring. It is envisaged that the relevant consents to
                              make required amendments will be requested by way of a separate CVA
                              consent request.
                              </p>
<p>The implementation of the CVA is critical to the liquidity of
                              the Group. Should the CVA fail for any reason, this would have a materially
                              negative impact on the liquidity of the Group and the Company.
                              </p>
<p>The CVA proposals, together with certain supporting documentation,
                              can be downloaded free of charge at www.steinhoffinternational.com/restructuring-documents.php.

                              its existing commercial relationship with Cencap, in a phased approach.
                              Under the current commercial agreements, Cencap, a subsidiary of Wands,
                              is responsible for the funding of credit books that provide credit
                              to customers of JD consumer credit and unsecured personal loans, Capfin
                              loans, using the Pep and Ackermans retail footprint. Wands carries
                              the credit risk related to these financial services. Pepkor, thought
                              its internal financial administration service operations, provides
                              administration and collection services to Cencap related to the JD

                              for a fee. Pepkor considered its options and decided not to pursue
                              the acquisition of the credit books owned by Cencap, but will instead
                              build its own credit books. With regard the existing credit books,
                              commercial agreements were renegotiated, granting Pepkor the right
                              to continue the collection of the Cencap owned loan books for the
                              run-down period of the books, up to a maximum period of three years
                              and render the outsourced services at a market-related fee. Pepkor
                              further agreed to purchase 100% of the issued shares in FGI Holdings
                              Proprietary Limited ("FGI") from Wands for a purchase price of approximately

                              operating leases. As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable

                              the Group is in the process of assessing what adjustments, if any,
                              are necessary for example because of the change in the definition
                              of the lease term and the different treatment of variable lease payments
                              and of extension and termination options. The project has not yet
                              been finalised due to the disruptions faced by the Group during the
                              period under review. It is therefore not yet possible to estimate
                              the amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that will
                              have to be recognised on adoption of the new standard and how this

<p>Management consider Steinhoff N.V. to be a holding company. The
                              Company's only assets are investments in other entities and loans
                              receivable, and therefore its income is limited to dividends and interest
                              income. Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses
                              on foreign denominated loans are recognised in other expenses.
                              </p>
<p>The statement of profit or loss has been revised to reflect the

                              has been adjusted to reflect the non-cash nature of unrealised foreign
                              exchange gains or loss on related party loans.

                              of prior period errors
                              </h4>
<p>On 5 December 2017, the Company announced that its 2017 separate
                              financial statements could not be released when expected as its external
                              auditor, Deloitte, had identified potential accounting irregularities
                              and questionable transactions.
                              </p>
<p>As a result of these concerns, an independent forensic investigation
                              (the "investigation") commenced. Consequently, the audited 2016 consolidated
                              financial statements were withdrawn and publication of the 2017 consolidated
                              financial statements was postponed.
                              </p>
<p>Management has determined that certain transactions required further
                              consideration. These transactions were assessed by management to have
                              been inappropriately recognised in the financial statements and required
                              correction.
                              </p>
<p>Accordingly, the 2016 separate financial statements have been restated.
                              There is no impact to the separate financial statements as at 1 July
                              2015.
                              </p>
<p>The following restatements are required to correct prior period
                              errors:

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.1 Initial
                              recognition of investments in subsidiaries
                              </h4>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">a) Recognition
                              at date Steinhoff N.V. was introduced as new holding company
                              </h4>
<p>Prior to the FSE listing, the ultimate parent of the Steinhoff
                              Group was SIHPL whose ordinary shares were traded on the JSE until
                              the inward listing took place on 7 December 2015. Thereafter the Company
                              became the primary listed entity on the FSE, with a secondary listing
                              on the JSE.
                              </p>
<p>SIHPL was simultaneously delisted from the JSE.</p>
<p>Immediately prior to SIHPL's delisting, it held all the ordinary
                              shares in SINVH. SINVH in turn held the investments in the African
                              subsidiaries and the European subsidiaries.
                              </p>
<p>At the date SIHPL was delisted it became a direct subsidiary of
                              the Company through a "Scheme of Arrangement" whereby every SIHPL
                              share held by a shareholder was swapped at a ratio of 1:1 for a Steinhoff
                              N.V. share. The Company therefore issued its ordinary shares to the
                              existing SIHPL shareholders and in return became the owner of every
                              SIHPL issued share.
                              </p>
<p>During November 2015 (immediately prior to the FSE listing), the
                              Company acquired the issued ordinary shares of Genesis Gamma for €20
                              million which included the kika-Leiner Retail business as well as
                              the Steinhoff European Retail assets (indirectly owned by GIH - a
                              subsidiary of Genesis Gamma).
                              </p>
<p>Previously, the acquisition by the Company (including kika-Leiner)
                              of the existing Steinhoff Group was treated as a reverse acquisition
                              with the Steinhoff Group considered as the acquiror. The initial investment
                              in SIHPL, in the separate financial statements of the Company, was
                              recognised at market value of €19.3 billion, being the equivalent
                              value of the issued share capital of the Company. Internal restructures
                              took place during April 2016 whereby the shares in the African and
                              European subsidiaries were unbundled at their respective market values
                              which were distributed to the Company as dividends in specie.
                              </p>
<p>Refer to note 1.2.3a) of the consolidated financial statements
                              whereby the acquisition of kika-Leiner by the Company during 2015
                              is restated as a common control transaction.
                              </p>
<p>Historically, at each step of the unbundling, the remaining investment
                              in subsidiary was impaired by the value of the dividend in specie
                              received from the subsidiary. As at 30 September 2016, the dividends
                              in specie received and the total impairment of the original investments
                              matched and were offset in the separate financial statements.
                              </p>
<p>The introduction of the Company as the new holding company of the
                              Steinhoff Group is no longer recognised as a reverse acquisition but
                              instead recognised as an internal reorganisation, whereby a new holding
                              company is introduced and the net asset value of the Group remains
                              unchanged before and after the internal reorganisation. In terms of
                              IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements ("IAS 27"), the cost of SIHPL
                              must be recognised by the Company at the net asset value of SIHPL
                              at the date of reorganisation.
                              </p>
<p>At the date of the reorganisation, SIHPL's net asset value comprises
                              mainly its investment in SINVH and loans receivable from subsidiaries.
                              SINVH's investments comprise mainly its investments in the Africa
                              and Europe group of companies together with group loans.
                              </p>
<p>After due consideration management has determined that at the date
                              of the internal reorganisation, the European group would have no recoverable
                              amount and the historical cost of the European Group of €2.5 billion,
                              as included in the investment value of SINVH, was excluded from the
                              recoverable net asset value at initial recognition of SIHPL.
                              </p>
<p>The excess of the share capital and share premium issued by the
                              Company on the date of listing, and the initial recognition value
                              of SIHPL is recognised as a reduction against share premium and amounts
                              to €13.8 billion as at 30 September 2016.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">b) Subsequent
                              internal reorganisation of Africa and European groups
                              </h4>
<p>The subsequent reorganisation of the investments in the Africa
                              and Europe groups relate to the unbundling of the investments in SINVH
                              and SFHG. The shares in SINVH and SFHG were distributed by SIHPL to
                              the Company as dividends in specie. The value of the dividends in
                              specie were originally calculated based on the pre-restatement market
                              values of these investments.
                              </p>
<p>Management has determined that the most appropriate value to recognise
                              the investments is at their historical cost to the Group, at initial
                              recognition, after adjustments for recoverability.
                              </p>
<p>The value of the dividend in specie was recognised as the recoverable
                              historical cost to the Group, which is different to the legal value
                              of the dividend declared at the time. SIHPL distributed its shares
                              in its investments to a new holding company solely for the purpose
                              of reorganisation as this did not constitute a distribution of profits
                              generated through SIHPL's operations or those of SIHPL's subsidiaries.
                              Management has therefore concluded the dividend in specie was in substance
                              an equity contribution from SIHPL and did not recognise the dividend
                              in profit or loss but recognised the dividend in specie directly in
                              equity as a non-distributable reserve.
                              </p>
<p>At the same time that the Company received the shares in SINVH
                              as a dividend in specie, and as part of the reorganisation, the Company
                              reduced the investment in SIHPL with the value of the dividend in
                              specie received. This reduction was recognised in equity against the
                              dividend in specie in the non-distributable reserve. The remaining
                              value of SIHPL in the Company is attributable solely to its loans
                              receivable from Group companies.
                              </p>
<p>The reorganised investments in subsidiaries were subjected to impairment
                              testing as described in note 1.4.
                              </p>
<p>These two transactions have a net zero impact on the non-distributable
                              reserve for the 2016 financial period.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.2 Recognition
                              of financial guarantees
                              </h4>
<p>The Company, together with certain subsidiaries, are guarantors
                              to third parties for certain external debt of Group companies. Refer
                              to note 16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete
                              view of the Group's external debt.
                              </p>
<p>The consequential impacts of the restatements to the 2015 and 2016
                              financial results of the Group as detailed in note 1.2 of the consolidated
                              financial statements together with the results of the performance
                              in the 2017 financial year indicates that the European subsidiaries
                              do not have sufficient liquid assets available to readily service
                              its external debt and loans due to Group companies. This, together
                              with the various other information and financial covenant breaches,
                              relating to the external debt of the Group (refer to note 16 in the
                              consolidated financial statements), would probably have resulted in
                              the unavoidable potential outflow of funds by the Company to settle
                              such debt.
                              </p>
<p>In order for the Company to perform under the guarantees, the Company
                              would have to call on loan receivables or liquidate equity investments.
                              Where the Company has a co-guarantor that has sufficient assets to
                              service the obligations under the external debt, the financial guarantee
                              has been recognised by that subsidiary company. The recognition of
                              the financial guarantee in the subsidiary company is taken into account
                              as part of the impairment testing of the investment in that subsidiary
                              company at period-end. All guarantees where the Company is a guarantor,
                              regardless of whether the guarantee has been recognised by a co-guarantor,
                              is presented as part of the contingent liabilities of the Company
                              as there is still a possibility that the Company might have to perform
                              under the guarantee until such a time as the debt is settled.
                              </p>
<p>The date that the Company becomes a guarantor to any debt of the
                              European group, as it is probable that the Company would have to perform
                              under the obligations, the financial guarantee is recognised immediately
                              in profit or loss. In all instances, the amortised cost or carrying
                              value of the debt has been recognised as the approximation of the
                              fair value of the financial guarantee, as this amount best represents
                              the amount to be settled by the Company had the debt provider called
                              on the loan. No penalties have been included in these balances and
                              the carrying value of the debt is shown gross of capitalised transaction
                              fees to ensure the full cash flow exposure to the Company is recognised.
                              </p>
<p>Upon acquisition of SUSHI, the Company became a guarantor to the
                              SUSHI debt. The guarantee was recognised at the same value as the
                              amortised cost of the acquisition funding and is akin to an equity
                              contribution to SUSHI. An additional investment in subsidiary of €2.3
                              billion was recognised at the same value as the guarantee. The investment
                              in subsidiary is considered for impairment in note 1.4.
                              </p>
<p>The impact on the net assets of the separate financial statements
                              of the Company, as a result of the recognition of the financial guarantees,
                              amounts to a decrease of €2 billion as at 30 September 2016. This
                              amount of €2 billion was recognised as an expense in profit or loss
                              during the 2016 financial period.
                              </p>
<p>Refer to note 10 for detailed considerations pertaining to the
                              various financial guarantees.
                              </p>
<p>The timing of the amounts recognised in note 1.1 and note 1.4 is
                              uncertain given the complexity and timing of the restatements to the
                              European and African groups. All transactions occurred during the
                              2016 financial year and therefore the impact to assets, liabilities
                              and total equity would remain the same as at 30 September 2016.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.3 Adjustments
                              to share-based payments
                              </h4>
<p>The Group implemented a long term share incentive scheme (the "ESRS"),
                              which was approved and ratified by shareholders on 1 December 2015.
                              The Remcom would set and monitor the achievement of the performance
                              targets in order for the ESRS to vest ("vesting criteria"). The ESRS
                              has open grants relating to the 2014, 2016 and 2017 financial periods.
                              Given the material restatements to prior periods, the Remcom would
                              have to apply significant discretion to approve the vesting of open
                              grants.
                              </p>
<p>Based on all the available financial information management has
                              revised its estimates of the number of shares likely to vest, and
                              considers all open grants highly unlikely to vest. Management has
                              therefore reversed the IFRS 2 expense for all open grants for all
                              financial periods.
                              </p>
<p>The impact to the separate financial statement of the Company further
                              includes the reversal of €29.5 million relating to the share scheme
                              settlement receivable from subsidiaries and a reversal of €6.3 million
                              of deferred dividends receivable from subsidiaries against the share-based
                              payment reserve.

                              of subsidiaries at period-end
                              </h4>
<p>Following the restatements throughout the Group, the investments
                              in subsidiaries were tested for impairment as at 30 September 2016.
                              </p>
<p>Following the finalisation of the restatements to the 2016 financial
                              results, the investment in SFHG, parent of the European Group, reported
                              a consolidated negative net asset value. This, together with the liquidity
                              pressures within the Group and the uncertainty regarding future funding
                              of operational needs, resulted in management fully impairing the investment
                              in SFHG. An impairment of €481 million was recognised in profit or
                              loss.
                              </p>
<p>The underlying net assets of SUSHI as at 30 September 2016 are
                              not sufficient to support the additional investment of €2.3 billion
                              recognised as per note 1.2. An impairment of €2.3 billion was recognised
                              in the 2016 financial period in profit or loss relating to the additional
                              investment in subsidiary of SUSHI.
                              </p>
<p>As at 30 September 2016, the Company had separate investments in
                              SIHPL and SINVH, both comprising components of the African Group.
                              The only value recoverable from the SIHPL Group was deemed to be its
                              underlying loans receivable from the SINVH Group. Any loans receivable
                              from the European Group in SIHPL were deemed irrecoverable. SIHPL,
                              as a co-guarantor, recognised the financial guarantees relating to
                              the 2021 and 2022 convertible bonds (refer note 1.2) and the recoverable
                              amount of SIHPL reduced to €182 million, resulting in an impairment
                              loss of €1.6 billion recognised in profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>The investment in SINVH was assessed for recoverability based,
                              as far as possible, on fair values of the underlying net assets of
                              the African Group.
                              </p>
<p>As at 30 September 2016, the African Group consisted of assets
                              totaling €6.7 billion. The material assets are: Pepkor Group, Unitrans
                              Automotive Group, Steinhoff Africa Properties Group, investments in
                              listed equity accounted companies; KAP Industrial Holdings Limited
                              and PSG Group Limited, unlisted investment in the Bud Group (formerly
                              IEP Group) and financial assets including listed shares in Brait SE
                              and a loan receivable from Fulcrum SA relating to the JD Financial
                              Services Loan Book. Pepkor was unlisted at this date and was included
                              in the Pepkor African Group at its purchase price value.
                              </p>
<p>As at 30 September 2016, the African Group had net debt amounting
                              to €1.3 billion and loans payable to the Company and SIHPL of €2.0
                              billion.
                              </p>
<p>The investment in SINVH exceeded its recoverable amount and an
                              impairment of €385 million was recognised in profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>The investment in the subsidiary company, Genesis Gamma was fully
                              impaired as Genesis Gamma no longer had any assets following an internal
                              reorganisation whereby GIH parent of the kika-Leiner group and a subsidiary
                              of Genesis Gamma, was moved into the European Group. An impairment
                              loss of €20 million was recognised in profit or loss.
                              </p>
<p>Refer to note 6 for the carrying values (recoverable amounts) of
                              each of the investments in subsidiaries.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">1.5 Impairment
                              of related party loans receivable
                              </h4>
<p>The related party receivables were assessed for recoverability
                              in the same manner as the investment in subsidiaries. Considerations
                              were given to the ability of the underlying assets of the European
                              and African Groups to service these related party receivables in the
                              near future. A further factor taken into consideration was that the
                              related party receivables were unsecured and had no fixed terms of
                              repayment.
                              </p>
<p>It was deemed that the loans receivable from the European Group
                              were irrecoverable and an impairment of €180 million was recognised

<p>Administration expenses relating to the various monthly and annual
                              fees of the JSE and FSE were incorrectly capitalised to share premium.
                              An amount of €1 million was reclassified to profit or loss during
                              the period.
                              </p>

                              SIHPL was restructured to become a direct subsidiary of SINVH. SINVH
                              issued shares amounting to €2.5 billion to its parent, Steinhoff N.V.
                              However, the carrying amount of SIHPL at the date of the reorganisation
                              amounted to €182 million. An additional investment in SINVH was recognised
                              at this value. At period-end, the recoverable value of SIHPL was deemed
                              to be zero due to the impairment of European loans receivable by SIHPL
                              (refer note 1.4) and the recognition of financial guarantees by SIHPL
                              relating to the 2021 and 2022 Convertible bonds (refer note 1.4 and
                              10). Pepkor Europe was reorganised during 2017, and was sold at market
                              value by the African Group to the European Group. This internal restructure
                              resulted in a decrease in the recoverable amount of the African Group
                              during 2017 and a corresponding increase in the recoverable amount
                              of the European Group. The increase in the recoverable amount of the
                              European Group was not sufficient to offset the current losses. The
                              various internal reorganisations (SIHPL and Pepkor Europe) together
                              with a decline in the fair values of certain underlying assets during
                              the period resulted in an impairment of €1.1 billion being recognised
                              during the period relating to the investment in SINVH.

                              Refer notes 10 and 11. This amount is akin to an equity contribution
                              and recognised as an investment in SIHPL, despite the internal reorganisation
                              referred to in note 3.2b). An impairment of the same value was recognised
                              immediately through profit or loss as SIHPL has no underlying recoverable
                              value. The €49 million represents the amount of the financial guarantee
                              of the 2021 and 2022 Convertible bonds that cannot be supported by
                              SIHPL. Refer to note 1.4 for details regarding the initial recognition
                              of the financial guarantee by SIHPL.

<p>The fair value of services received in return for share rights
                              granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share rights
                              granted. The estimated fair value of the services received is measured
                              based on the assumption that all vesting conditions are met and all
                              employees remain in service. The pricing model used was the Monte-Carlo
                              simulation. The volatility was estimated using the Steinhoff N.V./Steinhoff
                              International Holdings Limited daily closing share price over a rolling
                              three-year period.

<p>The fair value of the share scheme settlement receivable under
                              the ESRS is determined based on the Monte-Carlo simulation. The fair
                              value of the receivable is remeasured at each reporting date and at
                              the settlement date. The model inputs at 30 September 2017 were as
                              follows:

<p>Finco issued the 2021, 2022 and 2023 convertible bonds. The 2021
                              and 2022 convertible bonds are co-guaranteed by the Company and SIHPL.
                              The 2023 convertible bond is guaranteed solely by the Company.

                              the 2021 and 2022 convertible bonds and therefore only the outstanding
                              capital relating to the 2023 convertible bond was recognised by the
                              Company.
                              </p>
<p>The amounts recognised by the Company on behalf of the European
                              companies were immediately expensed in profit or loss as the subsidiaries
                              had insufficient underlying net assets to service the debt.
                              </p>
<p>Any guarantee recognised by the Company relating to an African
                              company is considered an equity contribution as it is likely that
                              the company has assets to support a recoverable amount greater than
                              zero. An amount of €49 million was recognised as an investment in
                              SIHPL, but assessed at year-end as irrecoverable and an impairment
                              of the same value was recognised in profit or loss relating to the
                              portion of the 2021 and 2022 bonds that SIHPL could not cover during
                              the period.

                              </h4>
<p>The other external debt is mostly held by SEAG, a direct subsidiary
                              of SFHG. SFHG is the ultimate parent company of the European Group
                              of companies. Following the restatements to the 2015 and 2016 financial
                              periods and the consequential impacts of the restatements on the 2017
                              financial period, the European Group of companies have insufficient
                              assets to service this debt. There are no co-guarantors that can support
                              this debt. As it is likely that the Company would have to step in
                              on behalf of SEAG under the performance obligations of this debt,
                              it recognised the carrying values of the liabilities, as these amounts
                              best approximate the fair value of the financial guarantee.
                              </p>
<p>During the period the Company recognised an additional €640 million
                              in profit or loss relating to the European companies financial guarantees
                              on other external debt.

                              debt
                              </h4>
<p>The SUSHI debt relates to the acquisition funding of Mattress Firm
                              as well as the operational funding. Any movement in the SUSHI debt
                              during the 2017 financial year represents the increase in the value
                              of the financial guarantee recognised by the Company. As a result
                              of the decrease in the net asset value of Mattress Firm during 2017,
                              it is unlikely that the company would have sufficient liquid assets
                              to support the recognition by the Company of an additional investment
                              and the increase in the SUSHI debt of €302 million is immediately
                              expensed in profit or loss by the Company.

                              </h4>
<p>The Company is a guarantor of the Hemisphere group's syndicated
                              rolling credit facility ("Hemisphere RCF"). As at 30 September 2017,
                              the amount drawn down under this facility amounted to €750 million
                              and in the prior year, €454 million.
                              </p>
<p>The Company considered whether any financial guarantee should be
                              recognised during either period presented relating to the Hemisphere
                              RCF and determined that at each period-end, the Hemisphere Group's
                              property portfolio value (post restatements - refer to note 1 of the
                              consolidated financial statements) is sufficient to cover the outstanding
                              debt balance, along with any other amounts owing.
                              </p>
<p>A portion of this financial guarantee will be recognised in 2018
                              following the disposal of the kika-Leiner Property portfolio. Refer
                              to note 16 for events occurring after the reporting period.

<td style="text-align:left;">In April 2015, Steinhoff Africa, an indirect subsidiary
                              of the
                              Company, issued 2000 B Class Perpetual Preference Shares at a subscription
                              price of R1.000.000 each to the Standard Bank of South Africa in order
                              to raise funding for the Pepkor acquisition. SIHPL provided a guarantee
                              to settle the obligation in the event of a breach of certain financial
                              covenants of the Group. The guarantee was transferred to the Company
                              on 13 February 2017. The Group is in technical breach of all of its
                              financial covenants and as a result the guarantee fulfills the criteria
                              to be classified as a financial liability in terms of IAS 32. It has
                              therefore been recognised in the Company's separate financial statements
                              as a financial liability. The amount is recognised at the cash settlement
                              value in terms of the preference share agreement. Finance costs are
                              accrued at 72% of the South African Prime lending rate, after adjusting
                              for 28% corporate income tax. The Company recognised a financial guarantee
                              which in substance results in the Company assuming an obligation to
                              pay on behalf of an indirect subsidiary. The recognition of this financial
                              liability is akin to an equity contribution by the parent to an indirect
                              subsidiary and an investment in Steinhoff Africa has been recognised
                              at the same value. The investment has been considered for impairment
                              as part of the impairment assessment of all investments in subsidiaries
                              at year-end and is not impaired. Management concluded the fair value
                              of the financial liability on initial recognition and at period-end
                              is not materially different to its amortised cost due to the preference
                              share instrument not being perpetual in nature and its redemption
                              that took place shortly after period-end at a value not materially
                              different to the amortised cost. This liability was settled by Steinhoff
                              Africa during the 2018 financial period as part of the Pepkor refinancing.
                              Refer to note 16 for events occurring after the reporting period.

<p class="list_p_fl">Following the events of December 2017, Hemisphere Group was

                              a Contingent Payment Undertaking ("CPU") was signed between the Company
                              and the lender group which had the effect of replacing the guarantee

                              €123.9 million being the expected residual amount that cannot be settled

<p>The Supervisory Board of the Company in its Report as well as the
                              Management Board in their Report have elaborated on the exceptional
                              circumstances under which these financials statements were prepared.
                              A public announcement was made on 5 December 2017, indicating serious
                              concerns that had arisen about potential accounting irregularities
                              during the course of the audit in the September-December 2017 timeframe.
                              </p>
<p>Following this public announcement, the Supervisory Board, through
                              its legal advisor Werksmans Attorneys, instructed PricewaterhouseCoopers
                              Advisory Services Proprietary Limited. ("PwC") to perform an independent
                              investigation into the allegations pertaining to the accounting irregularities.
                              </p>
<p>The results of this investigation have been presented to the Boards
                              of the Company. The Company and the Boards have provided us with access
                              to the PwC Investigation team and their report during our audit. There
                              are however a number of instances where no definitive conclusions
                              could be drawn, resulting in management being required to make significant
                              judgements, as described in the basis of preparation.
                              </p>
<p>As a result, there remain multiple uncertainties that potentially
                              interact with each other and for which the cumulative effect could
                              be significant to the financial statements as a whole. These uncertainties,
                              their potential interaction, as well as certain other matters are
                              described below.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Material uncertainty

                              </h4>
<p>The Company, as a result of the announcement, has had to renegotiate
                              the terms and conditions of its borrowing facilities with the Groups
                              of Lenders. This has resulted in 'Lock-Up-Agreements' followed by
                              a Company Voluntary Arrangement ("CVA"), as disclosed in the basis
                              of preparation - going concern assessment, which management have used
                              as the basis to assess the Company's ability to continue as a going
                              concern. Management has prepared these financial statements on the
                              basis that the Company is a going concern.
                              </p>
<p>Management has included its assessment, and the associated uncertainties
                              they have identified, in the basis of preparation (going concern assessment).
                              In which they have included:
                              </p>
<p>"The Management Board draws attention to the following facts:</p>

<p>Following the public announcement on 5 December 2017 and the subsequent
                              sharp decline in the stock price of the company's share, the Company
                              has received several claims from investors, which have been described
                              in (basis of preparation (litigation) and note 22.3). Although management
                              is unable to estimate the potential cash outflow in the case of unfavourable
                              decisions by the courts, the potential outflows of cash could be considerable
                              and also impact on the going concern assumption.

                              with respect to taxation effects on the restatements and adjustments
                              </h4>
<p>As a result of the accounting irregularities, management has recorded
                              restatements and adjustments affecting multiple years and multiple
                              tax-jurisdictions, as described in (basis of preparation (Tax)) and
                              Note 6 (uncertain tax positions)). Management has concluded that material
                              uncertainties remain in respect of the tax treatment of the restatements
                              and adjustments in multiple tax jurisdictions together with potential
                              implications from a transfer pricing perspective. Management is currently
                              unable to estimate the potential cash outflow for these tax uncertainties,
                              including the timing thereof. This could also have an impact on the
                              ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

<p>As explained in the basis of preparation under Areas of critical

                              it had control over certain entities within the Campion, Talgarth

<p>As explained in note 1.2.3.c (Conforama), under Areas of critical
                              judgements and estimates (consolidation decisions ii) the Company
                              is in litigation with Seifert/HLSW GmbH and LSW GmbH in relation to
                              the nature of his investment in Conforama. Management, in preparing
                              these financial statements, has treated the investment of Seifert
                              as a liability linked to the value of Conforama. The Company recognised
                              a provision equal to 23.6% of Conforama's equity value on 19 January
                              2015 for the termination settlement amount. The restatement resulted
                              in an increase in net assets at 30 September 2016 and 1 July 2015
                              of €138 million for each restated year. There was no impact to profit
                              or loss for the period ended 30 September 2016.

<p>The statement for profit or loss for the period ended 30 September
                              2017 includes a number of adjustments that were required to correct
                              the 30 September 2017 Statement of Financial Position based on the
                              information from the PwC Investigation as well as information obtained
                              by the Company. There is a material uncertainty whether the corrections
                              should have been recorded through the statement for profit or loss
                              or directly in retained earnings. We have not been able to obtain
                              sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the timing of the

                              </h4>
<p>As of 30 September 2017, the caption 'Property, Plant and Equipment'
                              includes land and buildings in the amount of €648 million (€972 million
                              as of 30 September 2016) regarding properties within the kika-Leiner
                              business, for which the acquisition (control date) was reassessed
                              as part of the restatement process (Note 1.2.3 a). In accounting for
                              the business combination as of that date, management was only able
                              to provide support for the fair value at acquisition for one of the
                              properties, for which the book value as of 30 September 2017 amounts
                              to approximately €93 million. Consequently, we were not able to obtain
                              sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the acquisition cost
                              currently recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the
                              remainder properties within this portfolio.
                              </p>
<p>Furthermore, Management obtained external valuations for these
                              properties as at 30 September 2017 (Note 9) which resulted in an impairment
                              of €351 million recorded in the Statement of Profit or Loss for the
                              period ended 30 September 2017. Due to the lack of support for the
                              acquisition cost, as detailed above, management determined the impairment
                              by comparing the fair value to the local GAAP book values and further
                              recorded the full impairment in the year due to previous valuations
                              not being available to determine the timing of these impairments (Note
                              9). Consequently, we were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate
                              audit evidence to support the impaired amount and timing thereof.
                              </p>
<p>As indicated in Note 34, as part of the subsequent events, most
                              part of this real estate portfolio was sold in 2018.

<p>In Note 25 (nature and purpose of other reserves) the composition

                              is uncertain as a result of the restatements and how this reserve
                              originated. We were therefore unable to obtain sufficient appropriate

<p>Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
                              of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9
                              of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible
                              for such internal control as management determines is necessary to
                              enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from
                              material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the
                              preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible
                              for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
                              Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should
                              prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of
                              accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company
                              or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do
                              so.
                              </p>
<p>Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast
                              significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going
                              concern in the financial statements.
                              </p>
<p>The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's
                              financial reporting process.

<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Our responsibilities
                              for the audit of the financial statements
                              </h4>
<p>Our responsibility is to conduct an audit of these financial statements
                              in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing
                              and to issue an auditor's report. However, because of the matter described
                              in the "Basis for disclaimer of opinion" section of our report, we
                              were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide
                              a basis for an audit opinion on the financial statements.
                              </p>
<h4 class="z_titel" style=" font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Other matters
                              related to our audit
                              </h4>
<p>Following serious concerns that arose about potential accounting
                              irregularities during the course of the audit in the last four months
                              of 2017 timeframe, and also at our request, the Supervisory Board
                              of the Company, through its legal advisor Werksmans Attorneys, instructed
                              PwC to perform an independent investigation into the allegations pertaining
                              to the accounting irregularities.
                              </p>
<p>In reaction to these events we re-evaluated our (audit) risk assessment,
                              the scoping of our audit and the involvement of our specialists and
                              revised the composition of our Group Engagement Team. We issued additional
                              audit instructions to our component auditors and increased our direct
                              involvement in other parts of the Group Audit. We intensified the
                              involvement of our specialists in the field of forensic-, realestate
                              valuation-, taxation -, going-concern-and restructuring expertise.
                              We furthermore performed audit procedures on the restatement process:
                              tracking and tracing restatements to investigation and underlying
                              audit evidence, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management
                              in their detailed analysis'.
                              </p>
<p>Throughout the audit, there was intensive communication with those
                              charged with governance: the Audit and Risk Committee and the Supervisory
                              Board
